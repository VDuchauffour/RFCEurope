		<English>[H1]Sunni Ali Ber[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]First great king of the Songhai Empire[\BOLD] [NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1464 - 1492 AD[NEWLINE] [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD] [PARAGRAPH:1]Demonized as an enemy of the faith by the Muslim narrative sources, yet lionized as a warrior hero in the oral tradition, Sunni Ali, who reigned from 1464 to 1492, is one of the most controversial figures of the African Middle Ages. A scion of the line of Songhai rulers who had risen to power after the decline of Mali in the fifteenth century, Sunni Ali was responsible for converting Songhai from a restless state tied to the eastern Niger into the largest empire ever known in the western Sudan.[PARAGRAPH:1]Relying on a swift and mobile cavalry force as well as on naval control of the Niger River, Sunni Ali had conquered the agriculturally rich central Niger including the wealthy and scholarly cities of Timbuktu and Jenne, by the 1470s. He also undertook expeditions against the Mossi and other rival kingdoms to the south.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nor was Sunni Ali simply a successful warrior. He was well aware that a vast empire could not be held together by military conquests alone, but need an effective and efficient administrative structure as well. Indeed, the organization of Songhai government, which was developed to a great degree under Sunni Ali, differed substantially from previous Sudanic patterns of empire. These had been based more on alliances and relationships with tributary states than on the high degree of centralization characteristic of Songhai.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Sunni Ali the Songhai Empire was divided up into territories which he placed under the rule of trusted lieutenants from his army. Traditional African cults and the observance of Islam were combined, much to the annoyance of Muslim clerics in the cities - and plots were hatched against his rule. On at least one occasion a group of clerics and scholars at an important Muslim centre were executed for treason.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sunni Ali died in 1492 as he returned from a punitive expedition against the Fulani. Oral tradition has him poisoned by Muhammad Ture, one of his commanders. A year later Muhammad Ture staged a coup d'etat against Sunni Ali's son, Sonni Baru, and founded a new dynasty of Songhai rulers. Askiya Muhammad Ture and his descendants were strict Muslims, who reinstated orthodox observance of Islam and outlawed traditional African religions.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the centuries which followed his death Muslim historians recorded Sunni Ali as "The Celebrated Infidel" or "The Great Oppressor". Songhai Oral tradition records that he was the righteous ruler of a mighty empire which stretched over 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles) along the Niger River.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
