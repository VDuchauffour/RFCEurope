		<English>[H1]Justinian I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Byzantine Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 11, 483 - November 13, 565 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Justinian the First, known as Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus in Latin, was emperor of the Byzantine Empire from 527 until his death in 565. His four decades of rule marked the greatest expansion of the Byzantine Empire since its split with the Roman Empire and a sweeping revival in the Christian religion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born in a small village in modern Macedonia, Justinian had little connection to power in Constantinople as a youth. It was the rise of his uncle, Justin, a Byzantine general who succeeded the Emperor Anastasius, which drew young Justinian from the Macedonian pastures into cosmopolitan Constantinople. Justinian served his uncle as a close advisor for a decade before the passing of Emperor Justin transferred the diadem to Justinian.[PARAGRAPH:2]With Justinian's rise to power, two other important faces rose to prominence. Belisarius, a close friend of Justinian, became the leader of Justinian's armies and proved himself as a brilliant tactician. The second face belonged to his beautiful and savvy wife, Theodora, who took on the role that Justinian himself once filled, that of the emperor's closest advisor.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of Justinian's first actions as Emperor was to order a collection of all Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis. But not long after the first issuing of the Corpus, an uprising among two rival chariot racing factions, the Blues and the Greens, engulfed Constantinople in a wave of violence and conflagration. Enterprising powers within the city allied against Justinian, using the chaos to declare a new Emperor, Hypatius, a nephew of Anastasius. Justinian, unsure of the strength of usurpers, decided to flee the city, but his brave wife refused. Instead, Belisarius was ordered to take two divisions and quell the uprising, which he did with ruthless ability, trapping rioters in the Hippodrome and killing nearly 30,000 before the riot was finally put down.[PARAGRAPH:2]The damage done to the city after the riots was substantial. Among the smoldering ruins lay the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople's greatest cathedral, burnt to the ground. Justinian thus began a monumental campaign to expand and restore the building. With its completion five years later, the reconstructed Hagia Sophia was christened as the world's largest cathedral, a title it would hold for a millennium. Under Justinian's order, twenty-five cathedrals were built in Constantinople alone, with many more built outside the capital city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Empire thrived under Justinian. Thanks in no small part to the able command of Belisarius, Emperor Justinian's reach spread from Constantinople to Southern Spain, with North Africa and Italy all falling under the Byzantine grasp. Justinian's reign marked a high point for the Byzantine Empire, as shortly after his death, much of the land conquered in his name was lost. War with powerful Germanic tribes and neighboring Persia would cost the empire much of its hard-fought gains.</English>

Ses quatre d&#233;cennies de r&#232;gne marquent la plus grande expansion de l'empire byzantin depuis sa scission avec l'empire romain, mais aussi un renouveau consid&#233;rable de la religion catholique.[PARAGRAPH:2]N&#233; dans un petit village de la Mac&#233;doine moderne, Justinien a peu de relations avec le pouvoir de Constantinople dans sa jeunesse. C'est l'ascension de son oncle Justin, g&#233;n&#233;ral byzantin qui succ&#232;de &#224; l'empereur Anastase, qui attire le jeune Justinien des p&#226;turages mac&#233;doniens vers la cosmopolite Constantinople. Justinien est conseiller de son oncle pendant une d&#233;cennie et &#224; sa mort, l'empereur lui transf&#232;re le diad&#232;me.[PARAGRAPH:2]Avec l'accession au pouvoir de Justinien, deux autres personnages commencent &#224; prendre de l'importance.

Le second personnage est sa femme, Th&#233;odora qui, aussi belle qu'intelligente, endosse le r&#244;le que Justinien a lui-m&#234;me rempli : conseiller de l'empereur.[PARAGRAPH:2]L'une des premi&#232;res action de Justinien en tant qu'empereur a &#233;t&#233; d'organiser les lois romaines du Corpus Juris Civilis. Mais peu apr&#232;s la premi&#232;re &#233;dition du Corpus, une r&#233;volte entre deux factions hippiques, les Bleus et les Verts, plonge Constantinople dans une vague de violence et de chaos. D'audacieuses puissances &#224; l'int&#233;rieur de la ville s'allient contre Justinien, se servant du chaos pour proclamer un nouvel empereur, Hypatius, neveu d'Anastase. Justinien, incertain de la force de ses usurpateurs, d&#233;cide de fuir la ville, mais sa courageuse femme refuse de partir. Elle ordonne &#224; B&#233;lisaire de prendre deux divisions et de mater la r&#233;volte, ce qu'il fait sans aucune piti&#233;, enfermant les insurg&#233;s dans l'hippodrome et tuant environ 30 000 hommes avant que la r&#233;volte ne soit finalement r&#233;prim&#233;e.[PARAGRAPH:2]Les d&#233;g&#226;ts caus&#233;s &#224; la ville apr&#232;s les &#233;meutes sont consid&#233;rables.

Justinien entame alors une campagne monumentale pour restaurer et agrandir le b&#226;timent. A la fin de sa reconstruction, cinq ans plus tard, Sainte-Sophie est proclam&#233;e plus grande cath&#233;drale du monde, titre qu'elle d&#233;tiendra pendant tout un mill&#233;naire. Sous le commandement de Justinien, vingt-cinq cath&#233;drales sont &#233;difi&#233;es &#224; Constantinople et bien davantage hors de la capitale.[PARAGRAPH:2]L'empire prosp&#232;re sous le r&#232;gne de Justinien.

Le r&#232;gne de Justinien marque l'apog&#233;e de l'empire byzantin et peu apr&#232;s sa mort, une grande partie des territoires conquis en son nom fut perdue. La guerre contre les puissantes tribus germaniques et la Perse voisine co&#251;tera &#224; l'empire une grande partie de ses gains durement acquis.</French>
		<German>[H1]Justinian I.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Kaiser des Byzantinischen Reiches[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 11. Mai 483 - 13. November 565 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Justinian I., auf Latein bekannt als Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus, war von 527 bis zu seinem Tod im Jahre 565 Kaiser der Byzantinischen Reiches. In den vier Jahrzehnten seiner Herrschaft erreichte das Byzantinische Reich seine gr&#246;&#223;te Ausdehnung seit der Trennung vom R&#246;mischen Reich - eine Zeit, die vom Wiederaufleben der christlichen Religion gepr&#228;gt war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Geboren in einem kleinen Dorf im heutigen Makedonien hatte Justinian als Jugendlicher wenig Bezug zur Macht in Konstantinopel. Mit dem Aufstieg seines Onkels Justin, einem byzantinischen General, der dem Kaiser Anastasius nachfolgte, kam der junge Justinian vom Weideland Makedoniens in das kosmopolitische Konstantinopel. Justinian diente seinem Onkel ein Jahrzehnt als enger Berater, bevor Kaiser Justin starb und Justinian den Thron bestieg.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit Justinians Macht&#252;bernahme betraten zwei weitere wichtige Figuren die politische B&#252;hne. Belisarius, ein enger Freund Justinians, wurde zum Anf&#252;hrer von Justinians Armeen ernannt und erwies sich als brillanter Stratege. Die zweite Figur war seine wundersch&#246;ne und kluge Frau Theodora, die die Rolle der engsten Beraterin des Kaisers &#252;bernahm - die Rolle, die einst Justinian selbst erf&#252;llt hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als eine der ersten Amtshandlungen gab Justinian die Sammlung des gesamten r&#246;mischen Rechts - des Corpus Juris Civilis - in Auftrag. Aber nicht lange nach dem ersten Erscheinen des Corpus fand ein Aufstand zwischen zwei rivalisierenden Wagenrenn-Fraktionen - den Blauen und den Gr&#252;nen - statt, der in Konstantinopel eine Welle der Gewalt ausl&#246;ste und Gro&#223;br&#228;nde verursachte. Handelsm&#228;chte innerhalb der Stadt verb&#252;ndeten sich gegen Justinian und nutzen das Chaos, um einen neuen Kaiser auszurufen: Hypatius, ein Neffe von Anastasius. Justinian, unsicher bez&#252;glich der St&#228;rke der Aufst&#228;ndischen, beschloss, aus der Stadt zu fliehen, doch seine mutige Frau widersetzte sich. Stattdessen wurde Belisarius befohlen, mit zwei Divisionen den Aufstand niederzuschlagen, was er skrupellos erledigte, indem er die Rebellen im Hippodrom in eine Falle lockte und fast 30.000 t&#246;tete, bevor der Aufstand schlie&#223;lich niedergeschlagen wurde.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Stadt hatte w&#228;hrend des Aufstands erheblichen Schaden erlitten. Zwischen den schwelenden Ruinen lag die Hagia Sophia, Konstantinopels gr&#246;&#223;te Kathedrale, die bis auf die Grundmauern abgebrannt war. Justinian leitete daraufhin eine Kampagne ein, um die Kirche wieder aufzubauen und zu vergr&#246;&#223;ern. F&#252;nf Jahre sp&#228;ter war der Wiederaufbau abgeschlossen und die Hagia Sophia wurde als die gr&#246;&#223;te Kathedrale der Welt eingeweiht - ein Titel, den sie 1000 Jahre lang tragen w&#252;rde. Unter Justinians Befehl wurden allein in Konstantinopel 25 Kathedralen errichtet, au&#223;erhalb der Hauptstadt waren es noch weitaus mehr.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Reich bl&#252;hte unter Justinian auf. Nicht zuletzt dank des f&#228;higen Kommandos von Belisarius reichte Kaiser Justinians Einfluss von Konstantinopel bis ins s&#252;dliche Spanien, und so gelangten auch Nordafrika und Italien in Reichweite Konstantinopels. Justinians Herrschaft markierte einen H&#246;hepunkt des Byzantinischen Reiches, das kurz nach seinem Tod viele Gebiete, die in seinem Namen erobert worden waren, wieder verlor. Kriege mit m&#228;chtigen germanischen St&#228;mmen und dem benachbarten Persien w&#252;rden das Reich gro&#223;e Teile seiner hart erk&#228;mpften Gewinne kosten.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Giustiniano I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imperatore dell'Impero Bizantino[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vita:[\BOLD] 11 maggio 483 - 13 novembre 565 d.C.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Informazioni:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Giustiniano I, in latino Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus, fu imperatore di Bisanzio dal 527 fino alla sua morte, nel 565. I quattro decenni del suo governo segnarono la pi&#249; grande espansione dell'Impero Bizantino dalla divisione dall'Impero Romano e un diffuso ritorno della religione cristiana.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nato in un piccolo villaggio dell'odierna Macedonia, da giovane Giustiniano aveva ben pochi collegamenti con il potere a Costantinopoli. Fu l'ascesa dello zio Giustino, un generale bizantino che successe all'imperatore Anastasio, a trascinare il giovane Giustiniano dai pascoli macedoni alla cosmopolita Costantinopoli. Giustiniano fu il consigliere dello zio per una decade, prima che la morte di Giustino trasferisse a lui il potere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Con l'ascesa al potere di Giustiniano divennero importanti altre due figure. Belisario, un caro amico di Giustiniano, divent&#242; il comandante dei suoi eserciti rivelandosi un brillante tattico. La seconda figura era l'arguta moglie di Giustiniano, Teodora, che assunse il ruolo che era stato del marito, ovvero quello di consigliere personale dell'imperatore.[PARAGRAPH:2]Una delle prime azioni di Giustiniano imperatore fu quella di ordinare una raccolta delle leggi romane, il Corpus Iuris Civilis. Ma non molto dopo l'emanazione del Corpus scoppi&#242; un lotta fra due fazioni sportive rivali, i Verdi e gli Azzurri, che fece sprofondare Costantinopoli in una spirale di violenza. Intraprendenti poteri nella citt&#224; si allearono contro Giustiniano, approfittando del caos per proclamare un nuovo imperatore, Ipazio, un nipote di Anastasio. Giustiniano, non conoscendo la forza degli usurpatori, decise di fuggire dalla citt&#224;, ma la coraggiosa Teodora si rifiut&#242;. Fu quindi ordinato a Belisario di prendere due divisioni e soffocare la rivolta, cosa che fece con spietata abilit&#224;, intrappolando i riottosi nell'Ippodromo e uccidendone quasi 30.000, prima che i disordini fossero definitivamente domati.[PARAGRAPH:2]I danni subiti dalla citt&#224; durante la rivolta furono importanti. Tra le rovine c'era anche Santa Sofia, la pi&#249; grande cattedrale di Costantinopoli, completamente bruciata. Giustiniano avvi&#242; quindi una monumentale campagna per espandere e ricostruire l'edificio. Al suo completamento, cinque anni pi&#249; tardi, la basilica di Santa Sofia fu inaugurata come la pi&#249; grande cattedrale al mondo, un titolo che mantenne per un millennio. Per ordine di Giustiniano, nella sola Costantinopoli furono costruite 25 cattedrali e molte altre lo furono fuori dalla capitale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sotto Giustiniano l'impero prosper&#242;. Grazie in gran parte all'abile comando di Belisario, il dominio dell'imperatore Giustiniano si estendeva da Costantinopoli al sud della Spagna, comprendendo anche il Nord Africa e l'Italia. Il regno di Giustiniano fu il culmine dell'Impero Bizantino e, poco dopo la sua morte, gran parte delle terre conquistate in suo nome fu perduta. Le guerre con potenti trib&#249; germaniche e con la vicina Persia sarebbero costate all'impero gran parte delle terre duramente conquistate.</Italian>

Fue el ascenso de su t&#237;o Justino, un general bizantino que suceder&#237;a a Anastasio en el trono, lo que atrajo al joven Justiniano desde las tierras macedonias a la cosmopolita capital. Justiniano sirvi&#243; como consejero a su t&#237;o una d&#233;cada entera antes de que, a la muerte de &#233;ste, la diadema imperial pasara a su cabeza.[PARAGRAPH:2]Con su ascenso al poder, otros dos importantes rostros cobraron mayor relevancia. Belisario, un buen amigo de Justiniano, se convirti&#243; en el jefe de sus ej&#233;rcitos, donde demostr&#243; sus grandes cualidades como estratega. El segundo rostro era el de su hermosa y erudita esposa, Teodora, quien ocup&#243; el puesto que el propio Justiniano hab&#237;a desempe&#241;ado en su d&#237;a como consejero principal del emperador.[PARAGRAPH:2]Una de las primeras acciones de Justiniano como emperador fue ordenar la recopilaci&#243;n de todas las leyes romanas en un c&#243;digo &#250;nico, el Corpus Juris Civilis. Pero, poco despu&#233;s de la primera publicaci&#243;n del corpus, el enfrentamiento de dos facciones rivales del hip&#243;dromo, los azules y los verdes, sumi&#243; a Constantinopla en una oleada de violencia y conflagraci&#243;n. Varios poderes f&#225;cticos de la ciudad se aliaron contra Justiniano y, aprovechando el caos reinante, nombraron a Hipacio, sobrino de Anastasio, nuevo emperador. Justiniano, ignorando la fuerza real de los usurpadores, decidi&#243; escapar de la ciudad, pero su valiente esposa se opuso. En lugar de abandonar la ciudad, Belisario recibi&#243; la orden de tomar dos legiones y sofocar la revuelta, cosa que cumpli&#243; con implacable eficiencia. Los alborotadores fueron atrapados en el hip&#243;dromo y casi 30.000 de ellos murieron antes de que la revuelta fuera finalmente sofocada.[PARAGRAPH:2]Los da&#241;os sufridos por la ciudad en el levantamiento fueron cuantiosos. Entre las ruinas humeantes se encontraba la Santa Sof&#237;a, la mayor catedral de Constantinopla, quemada hasta los cimientos. Justiniano emprendi&#243; entonces una campa&#241;a de restauraci&#243;n y ampliaci&#243;n del edificio. Al finalizar, cinco a&#241;os despu&#233;s, la reconstruida Santa Sof&#237;a se convirti&#243; en la catedral m&#225;s grande del mundo, un t&#237;tulo que conservar&#237;a durante un milenio. Justiniano levant&#243; otras veinticinco catedrales, solo en Constantinopla, y muchas m&#225;s fuera de la ciudad.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bajo el gobierno de Justiniano, el imperio prosper&#243;. Gracias en gran medida a la capacidad militar de Belisario, la autoridad del emperador Justiniano se extendi&#243; desde Constantinopla hasta el sur de Hispania, pasando por el norte de &#193;frica y el sur de Italia. El reinado de Justiniano marc&#243; un momento cumbre del poder&#237;o del Imperio Bizantino, pero poco despu&#233;s de su muerte se perder&#237;an muchas de las tierras conquistadas en su nombre.

		<English>[H1]Charlemagne[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, King of the Franks[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 742 - January 28, 814 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Charles the Great, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, fathered a kingdom that encompassed France, Germany, Italy and much of Eastern Europe. Legends of his conquests are pervasive throughout history, and he is considered one of the great figureheads of European Chivalric society.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his lifetime Charlemagne successfully campaigned in many countries. Some wars he completed personally and others were left for his sons to finish. His first campaign was against Desiderius of Lombardy who, soon after the succession of Pope Hadrian I, marched on Rome. Charlemagne pressed into Lombardy, and after a lengthy siege (772-774), he accepted Desiderius' unconditional surrender. Desiderius would live out the remainder of his life confined to a monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]The longest lasting and most challenging conquest of Charlemagne's reign would be that of Saxonia. It would be a theater that he would continually revisit during his lifetime. After Charlemagne's initial push into Saxonia he was continuously forced to retake previously conquered land which had rebelled against his authority. Weary of war and losing more rights and freedoms with every capitulation, the Saxons eventually accepted Charlemagne's terms, including renouncement of their national religious customs and adoption of the Christian faith and its associated Frankish customs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles was both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. He often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that he could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, Charles often contributed money to relieve the poor and sick in his kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charlemagne, despite being unable to write well himself, had a vast love of literature and education. Due to his conquests, Charlemagne came into contact with many different cultures and learning institutions. Having contributed considerable funding to existing monastic schools and institutions of learning, Charlemagne's era became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of both fictional and real people that represented the pinnacle of chivalry during their eras, Charlemagne was the embodiment of honor in both person and position. A conqueror, a philanthropist, lover of the arts and a highly devout Christian, Charlemagne stands as one of the important figures of the first millennium, and the forefather of Central Europe as it stands today. </English>

Ses conqu&#234;tes furent extr&#234;mement nombreuses et il est consid&#233;r&#233; comme l'une des grandes figures parmi les chevaliers d'Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Au cours de sa vie, Charlemagne mena avec succ&#232;s de nombreuses campagnes &#224; travers diff&#233;rents pays. Il en acheva certaines de son vivant, tandis que d'autres furent termin&#233;es par son fils. Sa premi&#232;re campagne fut men&#233;e contre Didier de Lombardie qui, peu apr&#232;s la succession du pape Adrien Ier, marcha sur Rome. Charlemagne envahit la Lombardie et, apr&#232;s un long si&#232;ge (772-774), accepta la retraite inconditionnelle de Didier de Lombardie. Didier de Lombardie v&#233;cut le reste de sa vie confin&#233; dans un monast&#232;re.[PARAGRAPH:2]La plus longue et la plus difficile conqu&#234;te du r&#232;gne de Charlemagne fut celle de la Saxe, qu'il dut reconqu&#233;rir plusieurs fois. Apr&#232;s sa premi&#232;re perc&#233;e en Saxe, il fut constamment oblig&#233; de reprendre les terres qu'il avait pr&#233;c&#233;demment conquises et qui s'&#233;taient ensuite rebell&#233;es contre son autorit&#233;. Lass&#233;s par la guerre et perdant davantage de droits et de libert&#233;s &#224; chaque capitulation, les saxons finirent par accepter les conditions de Charlemagne, y compris le renoncement &#224; leurs traditions religieuses et l'adoption de la foi chr&#233;tienne et de ses traditions franques.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles &#233;tait &#224; la foi un homme tr&#232;s religieux et un philanthrope. Il instaura &#224; plusieurs reprises des relations amicales avec d'autres pays, comme l'Egypte et l'Inde, afin de pouvoir envoyer de l'argent aux chr&#233;tiens qui luttaient dans ces r&#233;gions. Charles &#233;tait plus un conqu&#233;rant qu'un r&#233;formateur &#233;conomique ou social, mais il fit souvent des dons d'argent pour venir en aide aux pauvres et aux malades de son royaume.[PARAGRAPH:2]Incapable d'&#233;crire lui-m&#234;me, Charlemagne n'en vouait pas moins une grande affection &#224; la litt&#233;rature et l'&#233;ducation.

[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Karl der Gro&#223;e, Kaiser des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches, war Stammvater eines K&#246;nigreichs, das Frankreich, Deutschland, Italien und einen Gro&#223;teil Osteuropas umfasste. Die Geschichte ist voll von Legenden &#252;ber seine Eroberungen, und er gilt als einer der gr&#246;&#223;ten Vorreiter des europ&#228;ischen Rittertums.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zu seinen Lebzeiten unternahm Karl der Gro&#223;e erfolgreich Feldz&#252;ge in viele L&#228;nder. Manche Kriege brachte er selbst zu Ende, andere &#252;berlie&#223; er seinen S&#246;hnen. Sein erster Feldzug erfolgte gegen Desiderius von der Lombardei, der bald nach der Thronbesteigung Papst Hadrians I. gegen Rom aufmarschierte. Karl der Gro&#223;e drang in die Lombardei ein und nahm nach einer langen Belagerung (772 - 774) Desiderius' bedingungslose Kapitulation an. Desiderius sollte den Rest seines Lebens in Klosterhaft verbringen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die langwierigste und schwierigste Eroberung w&#228;hrend der Herrschaft Karls des Gro&#223;en war die Sachsens. Diesen Schauplatz sollte er w&#228;hrend seiner gesamten Lebenszeit immer wieder aufsuchen. Nach seinem ersten Vorsto&#223; nach Sachsen war Karl der Gro&#223;e immer wieder gezwungen, vormals erobertes Land, das sich gegen seine Herrschaft erhoben hatte, neu einzunehmen. Kriegsm&#252;de und unter dem Einfluss der nach jeder Niederlage wachsenden Verluste an Rechten und Freiheiten, akzeptierten die Sachsen schlie&#223;lich Karls Bedingungen, darunter die Aufgabe ihrer eigenen Naturreligion, die Konversion zum Christentum und die Annahme der damit verbundenen fr&#228;nkischen Br&#228;uche.[PARAGRAPH:2]Karl der Gro&#223;e war sowohl ein tiefgl&#228;ubiger Mensch als auch ein Wohlt&#228;ter. Er unterhielt oft freundschaftliche Beziehungen zu anderen L&#228;ndern, etwa &#196;gypten und Indien, so dass er sp&#228;ter Geld dorthin schicken konnte, um bed&#252;rftigen Christen in diesen Regionen zu helfen. Obwohl er eher ein Eroberer als ein wirtschaftlicher oder sozialer Reformer war, leistete Karl viele Beitr&#228;ge, um den Armen und Kranken in seinem Reich zu helfen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Obwohl Karl der Gro&#223;e selbst nicht gut schreiben konnte, hatte er eine gro&#223;e Vorliebe f&#252;r Literatur und Bildung. Durch seine Eroberungen kam Karl der Gro&#223;e viel mit verschiedenen Kulturen und Bildungseinrichtungen in Kontakt. Da er bestehende Klosterschulen und Bildungseinrichtungen finanziell stark f&#246;rderte, wurde die Epoche Karls des Gro&#223;en als die Karolingische Renaissance bekannt, in der Kunst und Wissenschaft eine Bl&#252;tezeit erlebten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Mitglied der Neun Guten Helden, einer Gruppe sowohl fiktiver wie realer Personen, die in ihrer jeweiligen Zeit die Bl&#252;te des Rittertums darstellten, verk&#246;rperte Karl der Gro&#223;e die Tugend der Ehre sowohl pers&#246;nlich als auch als Herrscher. Als Eroberer, Menschenfreund, Kunstliebhaber und tiefgl&#228;ubiger Christ, geh&#246;rt Karl der Gro&#223;e zu den wichtigen Figuren des ersten Jahrtausends und ist der Gr&#252;ndervater Mitteleuropas, wie wir es heute kennen.</German>

La sua prima campagna fu contro Desiderio, re dei Longobardi, che poco dopo l'elezione di papa Adriano I marci&#242; su Roma. Carlo Magno penetr&#242; in Lombardia e, dopo un lungo assedio (772-774), accett&#242; la resa incondizionata di Desiderio, che pass&#242; il resto della propria vita confinato in un monastero.[PARAGRAPH:2]La conquista pi&#249; lunga e impegnativa di Carlo Magno fu quella della Sassonia, un teatro di scontri che avrebbe visto continuamente durante la propria vita. Dopo la prima penetrazione, infatti, fu continuamente costretto a riconquistare terre precedentemente occupate che si erano ribellate alla sua autorit&#224;. Stanchi della guerra e dopo aver perso pi&#249; diritti e libert&#224; a ogni successiva conquista, i Sassoni alla fine accettarono i termini di Carlo Magno, compresa la rinuncia ai costumi religiosi nazionali e l'adozione della fede cristiana e dei costumi franchi a essa associati.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carlo era un uomo molto religioso e un filantropo. Spesso istitu&#236; relazioni amichevoli con altri Paesi, come Egitto e India, in modo da poter inviare pi&#249; tardi dei soldi nel tentativo di aiutare i cristiani in difficolt&#224; in quelle regioni. Nonostante fosse pi&#249; un conquistatore che un riformatore economico o sociale, Carlo spesso us&#242; del denaro per aiutare i poveri e i malati del suo regno.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carlo Magno, nonostante le sue difficolt&#224; nel leggere e nello scrivere, amava immensamente la letteratura e l'educazione. Grazie alle sue conquiste entr&#242; in contatto con molte culture e scuole diverse. Per i suoi contributi alle scuole monastiche e alle istituzioni scolastiche, l'era di Carlo Magno fu conosciuta come il Rinascimento carolingio e fu caratterizzata da un fiorire di arte e scienza.[PARAGRAPH:2]Quale membro dei Nove Prodi, un gruppo di personaggi reali e fittizi scelti per rappresentare gli ideali della cavalleria, Carlo Magno era la personificazione dell'onore sia come persona sia come posizione. Un conquistatore, un filantropo, amante delle arti e devoto cristiano, Carlo Magno si pone come una delle figure pi&#249; importanti del primo millennio e il progenitore dell'Europa centrale per come la conosciamo oggi. </Italian>

		<Portuguese>[H1]Charlemagne[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, King of the Franks[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 742 - January 28, 814 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Charles the Great, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, fathered a kingdom that encompassed France, Germany, Italy and much of Eastern Europe. Legends of his conquests are pervasive throughout history, and he is considered one of the great figureheads of European Chivalric society.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his lifetime Charlemagne successfully campaigned in many countries. Some wars he completed personally and others were left for his sons to finish. His first campaign was against Desiderius of Lombardy who, soon after the succession of Pope Hadrian I, marched on Rome. Charlemagne pressed into Lombardy, and after a lengthy siege (772-774), he accepted Desiderius' unconditional surrender. Desiderius would live out the remainder of his life confined to a monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]The longest lasting and most challenging conquest of Charlemagne's reign would be that of Saxonia. It would be a theater that he would continually revisit during his lifetime. After Charlemagne's initial push into Saxonia he was continuously forced to retake previously conquered land which had rebelled against his authority. Weary of war and losing more rights and freedoms with every capitulation, the Saxons eventually accepted Charlemagne's terms, including renouncement of their national religious customs and adoption of the Christian faith and its associated Frankish customs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles was both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. He often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that he could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, Charles often contributed money to relieve the poor and sick in his kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charlemagne, despite being unable to write well himself, had a vast love of literature and education. Due to his conquests, Charlemagne came into contact with many different cultures and learning institutions. Having contributed considerable funding to existing monastic schools and institutions of learning, Charlemagne's era became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of both fictional and real people that represented the pinnacle of chivalry during their eras, Charlemagne was the embodiment of honor in both person and position. A conqueror, a philanthropist, lover of the arts and a highly devout Christian, Charlemagne stands as one of the important figures of the first millennium, and the forefather of Central Europe as it stands today. </Portuguese>

		<English>[H1]Louis XIV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of France[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 5, 1638 - September 1, 1715 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to King Louis XIII of France, Louis XIV was raised in the most opulent court in Europe. His every need was catered to, and he was given an excellent education, even if he was too lazy and spoiled to appreciate it. Louis XIII died when his son was five, and the regency passed to the queen mother, Anne of Austria. For the next 18 years she ruled France with the able assistance of Cardinal Mazarin, who may or may not have also been her lover, while Louis lived in pampered splendor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was upon Mazarin's death in 1661 that the 22-year-old Louis XIV began to take an active interest in ruling his country. Much to everyone's surprise, he was good at it. First he gathered all of the power into his own hands, bypassing the old bureaucratic patronage system that Mazarin and his predecessors had used. He enticed the great nobles to his court, where he heaped upon them titles, honorary positions, and financial rewards, while at the same time undermining their actual power. In Louis' court, great noblemen - whose parents had fought for the crown of France itself - fought each other for the privilege of watching Louis shave.[PARAGRAPH:2]In person Louis was said to possess a great natural dignity and bearing. He was unfailingly courteous and usually honest, but he could dissimulate with the best of them when need-be.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his early reign Louis's court was known for its debauchery, and Louis himself had several mistresses. As his reign progressed, however, Louis became more devout, and he even married his last mistress (although in secret). Louis also became a patron of the arts, and literature and painting flourished under his rule. He built many great buildings and palaces, including the grand palace at Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite France's wealth, the country remained virtually bankrupt, not only because it had to pay for all the gifts that Louis gave his favorites, but, more importantly, it had to pay for all the wars of conquest that Louis embarked upon. Although a sound and thoughtful ruler at home, Louis had a great thirst for international "glory" - which in his terms meant victory on the battlefield. He constantly fought his neighbors, often for the most trivial reasons, gaining little but glory from the wars. Though he left the army and navy in splendid condition, he left his country's treasury bare.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a reign of 72 years, Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday. His body lies in Saint-Denis Basilica, outside Paris. Louis XIV is the longest reigning European monarch of all time.</English>

Louis XIII meurt alors que son fils n'a que cinq ans et la r&#233;gence est confi&#233;e &#224; la reine-m&#232;re, Anne d'Autriche. Durant les 18 ann&#233;es suivantes, elle dirige la France avec l'aide du talentueux cardinal Mazarin, qui est peut-&#234;tre &#233;galement son amant, tandis que Louis est choy&#233; et vit dans la splendeur.[PARAGRAPH:2]C'est apr&#232;s la mort de Mazarin en 1661 que Louis XIV, alors &#226;g&#233; de 22 ans, commence &#224; manifester un vif int&#233;r&#234;t pour la gestion de son pays. A la surprise quasi g&#233;n&#233;rale, il se montre tr&#232;s comp&#233;tent. Il rassemble d'abord tous les pouvoirs entre ses mains, contournant le vieux syst&#232;me bureaucratique de patronage que Mazarin et ses pr&#233;d&#233;cesseurs utilisaient. Il attire les grands nobles &#224; sa cour et leur offre titres, fonctions honoraires et r&#233;compenses financi&#232;res tout en sapant leur pouvoir r&#233;el. A la cour de Louis XIV, les grands aristocrates, dont les parents avaient lutt&#233; pour la couronne de France, se battent pour avoir le privil&#232;ge de voir le roi se raser.[PARAGRAPH:2]On dit que Louis XIV poss&#232;de une grande dignit&#233; naturelle et une allure imposante. Il est &#233;ternellement courtois et g&#233;n&#233;ralement honn&#234;te, mais il peut dissimuler ces qualit&#233;s si le besoin s'en fait sentir.[PARAGRAPH:2]Au d&#233;but du r&#232;gne de Louis XIV, sa cour est c&#233;l&#232;bre pour sa d&#233;bauche, le roi lui-m&#234;me ayant plusieurs ma&#238;tresses. Au fil du temps, il gagne en d&#233;votion et &#233;pouse m&#234;me sa derni&#232;re ma&#238;tresse (secr&#232;tement toutefois). Louis devient &#233;galement m&#233;c&#232;ne, la litt&#233;rature et la peinture prosp&#232;rent sous son r&#232;gne. Il construit de nombreux b&#226;timents et ch&#226;teaux magnifiques, et notamment le grandiose ch&#226;teau de Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Malgr&#233; la richesse de la France, le pays est au bord de la faillite, non seulement &#224; cause des cadeaux que Louis XIV offre &#224; ses favoris, mais aussi, et surtout, &#224; cause des guerres de conqu&#234;te dans lesquelles il s'est engag&#233;. La reconnaissance interne de sa gestion saine et r&#233;fl&#233;chie ne suffit pas &#224; Louis XIV, il recherche &#233;galement une "popularit&#233;" internationale qui passe par la gloire sur les champs de bataille. Il combat sans cesse ses voisins, souvent pour les raisons les plus insignifiantes, ces guerres ne lui apportant rien, si ce n'est la c&#233;l&#233;brit&#233;. Si &#224; sa mort, l'arm&#233;e et la marine sont dans un excellent &#233;tat, il l&#232;gue par ailleurs un pays sans aucune tr&#233;sorerie.[PARAGRAPH:2]Louis XIV meurt apr&#232;s avoir r&#233;gn&#233; pendant 72 ans sur la France.</French>

Bis zu seinem 13. Lebensjahr lebte er allerdings unter der Regentschaft seiner Mutter Anna von &#214;sterreich. Die tats&#228;chliche Macht &#252;bte in jener Zeit allerdings Kardinal Mazarin aus. Dieser bereitete Ludwig gezielt auf seine Rolle als Herrscher vor und beteiligte diesen Schritt f&#252;r Schritt an der Macht.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Mazarin Anfang 1661 starb, war der inzwischen 22-j&#228;hrige K&#246;nig gut auf sein Amt vorbereitet und verk&#252;ndete dem Staatsrat, dass er fortan allein regieren werde. Auf diese Weise gelang es ihm, das noch unter Mazarin &#252;bliche b&#252;rokratische G&#252;nstlingssystem abzuschaffen. Den Adel &#252;berh&#228;ufte Ludwig mit Titeln, Ehrenposten und Geld, w&#228;hrend er dessen tats&#228;chliche Macht mehr und mehr untergrub.

Luigi XIII mor&#236; quando suo figlio aveva soltanto cinque anni e la reggenza pass&#242; in mano alla regina madre, Anna d'Austria. Per i 18 anni successivi, govern&#242; la Francia con l'abile assistenza del cardinale Mazarin, di cui era forse l'amante, mentre Luigi viveva tra il vizio e lo splendore.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alla morte di Mazarin, nel 1661, il ventiduenne Luigi XIV inizi&#242; a interessarsi al governo del proprio paese: con grande sorpresa di tutti, si rivel&#242; un abile governatore. Come prima cosa, riun&#236; tutto il potere nelle proprie mani, eliminando il vecchio sistema burocratico del patronato che Mazarin e i suoi predecessori avevano utilizzato, poi attir&#242; a corte i grandi nobili, dove avrebbe potuto ricoprirli di titoli, posizioni onorarie e ricompense finanziarie, erodendone allo stesso tempo il vero potere. Nella corte di Luigi, i grandi nobiluomini, i cui antenati in passato avevano lottato per la corona di Francia, ora lottavano per il privilegio di assistere alla rasatura di Luigi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Si dice che Luigi possedesse grande dignit&#224; e portamento naturali: era incredibilmente educato e solitamente onesto, ma poteva ingannare anche il pi&#249; attento osservatore, quando fosse stato necessario.[PARAGRAPH:2]All'inizio del suo regno, la corte di Luigi era famosa per la sua dissolutezza e Luigi stesso aveva diverse amanti. Con gli anni, tuttavia, Luigi divenne pi&#249; devoto e spos&#242; persino la sua ultima amante (sebbene in segreto). Luigi divenne inoltre un grande patrono delle arti, e letteratura e pittura fiorirono durante il suo governo. Costru&#236; sfarzosi edifici e palazzi, inclusa la sua reggia di Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nonostante la ricchezza della Francia, il paese rest&#242; praticamente in bancarotta, non solo perch&#233; doveva pagare per tutti i doni che Luigi distribuiva ai suoi favoriti, ma, soprattutto, poich&#233; doveva finanziare tutte le guerre di conquista intraprese da Luigi. Sebbene fosse un governatore serio e riflessivo a casa, Luigi aveva un grande desiderio di "gloria" internazionale, che per lui significava la vittoria sul campo di battaglia. Era sempre in lotta con i suoi vicini, spesso per le ragioni pi&#249; futili, nonostante questi scontri gli portassero soltanto la gloria. Al termine del suo regno, lasci&#242; l'esercito e la flotta navale in ottime condizioni, ma, al tempo stesso, prosciug&#242; la tesoreria nazionale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Luigi XIV mor&#236; dopo aver governato la Francia per 72 anni.</Italian>

Luis XIII muri&#243; cuando su hijo ten&#237;a cinco a&#241;os, y la regencia recay&#243; en las manos de la reina madre, Ana de Austria. Durante los dieciocho a&#241;os siguientes, Ana gobern&#243; con la ayuda del cardenal Mazarino (quien tal vez fuese tambi&#233;n su amante), mientras Luis viv&#237;a envuelto en un exceso de esplendor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Fue a la muerte de Mazarino, en 1661, cuando Luis XIV, a la saz&#243;n un joven de 22 a&#241;os, empez&#243; a interesarse m&#225;s activamente por el gobierno de su pa&#237;s. Para sorpresa generalizada, demostr&#243; grandes aptitudes. Para empezar, reuni&#243; todo el poder en sus propias manos, desmontando el anticuado sistema de patronazgo burocr&#225;tico empleado por Mazarino y sus predecesores. Reuni&#243; a todos los nobles importantes en su corte, donde los colm&#243; de t&#237;tulos, honores y recompensas econ&#243;micas, al mismo tiempo que minaba su poder real. En la corte de Luis, los grandes nobles, cuyos antecesores hab&#237;an luchado por la Corona de Francia, peleaban por el derecho a presenciar el afeitado del rey.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seg&#250;n parece, en persona Luis pose&#237;a gran dignidad y un porte regio. Siempre se mostraba cort&#233;s, y normalmente honesto, pero en caso necesario pod&#237;a ser tan sibilino como el que m&#225;s.[PARAGRAPH:2]Durante los primeros a&#241;os de su reinado, su corte se hizo famosa por su depravaci&#243;n, y el propio Luis tuvo varias amantes. Sin embargo, a medida que avanzaba el tiempo, la piedad del rey fue en aumento, e incluso lleg&#243; a casarse con su &#250;ltima amante (aunque en secreto). Tambi&#233;n fue un mecenas de las artes, y bajo su reinado florecieron la literatura y la pintura. Construy&#243; muchos grandes edificios y palacios, incluido el enorme complejo palacial de Versalles.[PARAGRAPH:2]A pesar de la riqueza de Francia, el pa&#237;s se manten&#237;a virtualmente en estado de bancarrota, no solo porque hubiera que pagar los regalos que Luis hac&#237;a a sus favoritos, sino, y mucho m&#225;s importante, por la necesidad de costear las guerras de conquista en las que se embarcaba. Aunque desde el punto de vista interno era un gobernante razonable y sensato, Luis ten&#237;a una inagotable sed de "gloria" internacional... lo que, desde su punto de vista, significaba victorias en el campo de batalla. Constantemente se enfrentaba a sus vecinos, a menudo por las m&#225;s triviales de las razones sin que estas guerras proporcionaran gran cosa al pa&#237;s, aparte de gloria. Dej&#243; el ej&#233;rcito y la marina en magn&#237;ficas condiciones, pero a costa de agotar los cofres del reino.[PARAGRAPH:2]Luis XIV muri&#243; tras setenta y dos a&#241;os de reinado.</Spanish>
		<Portuguese>[H1]Louis XIV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of France[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 5, 1638 - September 1, 1715 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to King Louis XIII of France, Louis XIV was raised in the most opulent court in Europe. His every need was catered to, and he was given an excellent education, even if he was too lazy and spoiled to appreciate it. Louis XIII died when his son was five, and the regency passed to the queen mother, Anne of Austria. For the next 18 years she ruled France with the able assistance of Cardinal Mazarin, who may or may not have also been her lover, while Louis lived in pampered splendor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was upon Mazarin's death in 1661 that the 22-year-old Louis XIV began to take an active interest in ruling his country. Much to everyone's surprise, he was good at it. First he gathered all of the power into his own hands, bypassing the old bureaucratic patronage system that Mazarin and his predecessors had used. He enticed the great nobles to his court, where he heaped upon them titles, honorary positions, and financial rewards, while at the same time undermining their actual power. In Louis' court, great noblemen - whose parents had fought for the crown of France itself - fought each other for the privilege of watching Louis shave.[PARAGRAPH:2]In person Louis was said to possess a great natural dignity and bearing. He was unfailingly courteous and usually honest, but he could dissimulate with the best of them when need-be.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his early reign Louis's court was known for its debauchery, and Louis himself had several mistresses. As his reign progressed, however, Louis became more devout, and he even married his last mistress (although in secret). Louis also became a patron of the arts, and literature and painting flourished under his rule. He built many great buildings and palaces, including the grand palace at Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite France's wealth, the country remained virtually bankrupt, not only because it had to pay for all the gifts that Louis gave his favorites, but, more importantly, it had to pay for all the wars of conquest that Louis embarked upon. Although a sound and thoughtful ruler at home, Louis had a great thirst for international "glory" - which in his terms meant victory on the battlefield. He constantly fought his neighbors, often for the most trivial reasons, gaining little but glory from the wars. Though he left the army and navy in splendid condition, he left his country's treasury bare.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a reign of 72 years, Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday. His body lies in Saint-Denis Basilica, outside Paris. Louis XIV is the longest reigning European monarch of all time.</Portuguese>

		<English>[H1]Elizabeth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Virgin Queen of England[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 7, 1533 - March 24, 1603 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born to King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, who her father had executed for failing to give him a male heir, Elizabeth's early life was filled with danger. Growing up an unwanted daughter of a insane father who was destroying England's ties to the Catholic Church and engaging in civil war so that he could legally marry another woman (several other women, in fact), Elizabeth had to use all of her wits to survive. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth received an excellent education at the hands of various tutors, including the great scholars of the day. She was an outstanding student, and could speak five languages fluently. [PARAGRAPH:2]When King Henry VIII died, the throne passed to his young son, Edward. At fifteen Elizabeth was implicated in a plot to overthrow him. She came close to being executed, surviving only because she was able to convince her skeptical interrogators that she knew nothing of the plot. [PARAGRAPH:2]When King Edward died in 1553, Elizabeth's older sister, Mary, assumed the throne. An ardent Catholic, Mary was quite unpopular with a number of Protestant noblemen, who attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow her in 1554. Once again Elizabeth was implicated, but once again she talked her way out of execution. [PARAGRAPH:2]Queen Mary died in 1558, and Elizabeth became Queen. Elizabeth was an extraordinary ruler. She established the Protestant Church as the official Church of England. However, she attempted to stem the persecution of Catholics in the country - at least as much as was possible when the Catholic nobility were actively plotting her demise. She restored the debased currency of England, and she made England a center of culture, where great artists like William Shakespeare flourished. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth used all of the tools available to her to achieve her goals. She received countless offers of marriage from nobility and indeed from kings across Europe. But she accepted none of them, instead using her unmarried state to control her friends and foes alike; if one faction got too strong, she could drive them back into line by suggesting that she was considering marrying someone from an opposing faction. [PARAGRAPH:2]Militarily, Catholic Spain was England's greatest threat. Spain was the great continental power of the day, and its leader, King Philip, had upon more than one occasion expressed the intent of invading England. In 1588 he tried, building a huge armada to conquer the upstart nation. Elizabeth quickly organized the country's navy to fend off the fleet, and by a combination of superior tactics, ship design, and some foul weather at just the right moment, they defeated the Spanish foe. England was not to be seriously threatened with invasion for about 400 years. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth died in 1603, having left her country in far better state. No better words can serve to describe her than her own: "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king."</English>
		<French>[H1]Elizabeth[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Reine d'Angleterre[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dates:[\BOLD] 1533 - 1603[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]N&#233;e de l'union du roi Henri VIII et d'Anne Boleyn, ex&#233;cut&#233;e par son mari pour ne pas lui avoir donn&#233; d'h&#233;ritier m&#226;le, Elizabeth a un d&#233;but de vie difficile. Elle appara&#238;t comme la fille non d&#233;sir&#233;e d'un p&#232;re fou, qui coupe les liens de l'Angleterre avec l'Eglise catholique et engage une guerre civile afin de pouvoir se marier l&#233;galement avec une autre femme (avec plusieurs femmes en fait). Elle doit donc utiliser toute son intelligence pour survivre. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth re&#231;oit une excellente &#233;ducation, assur&#233;e par divers tuteurs et notamment de grands savants de l'&#233;poque. C'est une excellente &#233;l&#232;ve et elle parle couramment cinq langues. [PARAGRAPH:2]A la mort du roi Henri VIII, son jeune fils Edouard lui succ&#232;de. A l'&#226;ge de 15 ans, Elizabeth est impliqu&#233;e dans un complot visant &#224; le renverser. Elle &#233;chappe de peu &#224; l'ex&#233;cution, ne survivant que gr&#226;ce &#224; sa capacit&#233; &#224; convaincre ses interrogateurs sceptiques qu'elle n'avait aucune connaissance de ce complot. [PARAGRAPH:2]A la mort d'Edouard VI en 1553, la soeur a&#238;n&#233;e d'Elizabeth acc&#232;de au tr&#244;ne. Fervente catholique, Marie Tudor est relativement impopulaire aupr&#232;s de nombreux nobles protestants qui tentent sans succ&#232;s de la renverser en 1554. Une fois encore, Elizabeth est impliqu&#233;e mais ses propos convaincants lui permettent d'&#233;chapper &#224; l'ex&#233;cution. [PARAGRAPH:2]La reine Marie Tudor meurt en 1558 et Elizabeth devient reine, elle s'av&#232;re alors &#234;tre une souveraine extraordinaire. Elle fait de l'Eglise protestante l'Eglise officielle d'Angleterre mais tente n&#233;anmoins de limiter les pers&#233;cutions des catholiques dans le pays, du moins tant qu'elle le peut, alors que la noblesse catholique complote activement pour la faire dispara&#238;tre. Elle r&#233;tablit la monnaie anglaise d&#233;pr&#233;ci&#233;e et fait de l'Angleterre un centre culturel o&#249; prosp&#232;rent de nombreux artistes tel William Shakespeare. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth utilise tous les instruments &#224; sa disposition pour parvenir &#224; ses fins. Elle re&#231;oit d'innombrables demandes en mariage de la part de nobles et m&#234;me de rois de toute l'Europe. Elle n'en accepte cependant aucune, jouant de son statut de reine c&#233;libataire pour contr&#244;ler ses amis tout comme ses ennemis. Si l'une des parties va trop loin, elle peut la ramener dans le droit chemin en lui faisant savoir qu'elle envisage d'&#233;pouser un membre de la partie adverse. [PARAGRAPH:2]A cette &#233;poque, l'Espagne catholique constitue la principale menace militaire pour l'Angleterre. C'est en effet la plus grande puissance continentale &#224; cette &#233;poque et son chef, le roi Philippe II, a fait part &#224; plusieurs reprises de son intention d'envahir l'Angleterre. En 1588, il essaie de conqu&#233;rir l'ambitieuse nation en construisant une immense armada. Elizabeth organise rapidement la marine de son pays pour repousser la flotte et gr&#226;ce &#224; des tactiques plus efficaces, des navires plus adapt&#233;s et des conditions climatiques &#233;pouvantables au moment opportun, l'ennemi espagnol est repouss&#233;. Pendant pr&#232;s de 400 ans, l'Angleterre ne sera plus v&#233;ritablement menac&#233;e d'invasion. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth meurt en 1603, laissant un pays florissant. Nuls autres mots ne la d&#233;crivent mieux que les siens : "Je sais que j'ai le corps fragile et faible d'une femme, mais j'ai l'ardeur et le courage d'un roi".</French>

Als Letztere Heinrich keinen Thronerben schenkte, lie&#223; dieser seine eigene Frau t&#246;ten. Elisabeth wuchs als ungeliebte Tochter eines Vaters auf, der sich aufgrund seiner Scheidung von Katharina von Arag&#243;n mit der Katholischen Kirche &#252;berworfen und sich von dieser abgewandt hatte. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elisabeth genoss eine erstklassige Ausbildung durch die bedeutendsten Gelehrten ihrer Zeit. Sie war eine aufmerksame Sch&#252;lerin und beherrschte f&#252;nf Sprachen flie&#223;end. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Tod ihres Vaters bestieg dessen j&#252;ngster Sohn Eduard den englischen Thron. [PARAGRAPH:2]Als Eduard VI. 1553 starb, bestieg Elisabeths Halbschwester Maria I. den englischen Thron. Die &#252;berzeugte Katholikin wollte die anglikanische Elisabeth zu ihrem Glauben bekehren. Als schlie&#223;lich Marias Pl&#228;ne zur Heirat mit Philipp II. von Spanien bekannt wurden, kam es zur Wyatt-Verschw&#246;rung. Elisabeth wurde daraufhin ebenfalls des Verrats bezichtigt und in den Tower gesperrt. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nach Marias Tod im Jahr 1558 wurde Elisabeth zur K&#246;nigin von England, Irland und Frankreich gekr&#246;nt. 1563 wandte sie sich endg&#252;ltig vom Katholizismus ab und wurde von Papst Pius V. exkommuniziert. Trotz ihrer Abkehr vom Katholizismus versuchte Elizabeth, die Verfolgung von Katholiken einzud&#228;mmen. Allerdings war dies nicht ganz einfach, da ihr der - weitgehend katholische Adel - nach dem Leben trachtete. Unter Maria erlebte das Land eine wirtschaftliche und kulturelle Bl&#252;tezeit, da Elisabeth das b&#252;rgerliche Theater und K&#252;nstler, wie Shakespeare oder Francis Bacon stets f&#246;rderte. [PARAGRAPH:2]Elisabeth nutzte alle verf&#252;gbaren Mittel, um ihre Ziele zu erreichen. Trotz unz&#228;hliger Heiratsantr&#228;ge verschiedener europ&#228;ischer Adliger und K&#246;nige blieb sie zeitlebens unverheiratet, um Freunde und Feinde kontrollieren zu k&#246;nnen. Wurde eine Gruppierung zu stark, gen&#252;gte meist die Ank&#252;ndigung einer m&#246;glichen Hochzeit mit einem Rivalen, um die Wogen wieder zu gl&#228;tten. [PARAGRAPH:2]Au&#223;enpolitisch drohte England vor allem von Spanien Gefahr, zumal der spanische K&#246;nig mehr als einmal erkl&#228;rt hatte, England erobern zu wollen. 1588 lie&#223; er zu diesem Zweck eine riesige Armada bauen, um England in die Knie zu zwingen. Doch der englischen Flotte gelang es, die spanische Invasion abzuwehren. [PARAGRAPH:2]Als Elisabeth im Jahr 1603 starb, hinterlie&#223; sie ein K&#246;nigreich, das sie wie niemand vor ihr gepr&#228;gt und gest&#228;rkt hatte. Wer k&#246;nnte diese Frau also besser beschreiben, als sie selbst? "Ich wei&#223;, dass ich den K&#246;rper einer schwachen Frau besitze, aber ich habe das Herz und den Magen eines K&#246;nigs."</German>

Cresciuta come figlia indesiderata da un padre folle, intento a distruggere i legami dell'Inghilterra con la Chiesa Cattolica, pronto a causare una guerra civile pur di poter legalmente sposare un'altra donna (in realt&#224;, molte altre donne), Elisabetta dovette usare tutta la sua astuzia per sopravvivere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elisabetta ricevette un'eccellente educazione da diversi insegnanti, compresi i migliori studiosi dell'epoca. Si rivel&#242; una studentessa modella e impar&#242; a parlare fluentemente cinque lingue.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alla morte di Enrico VIII, il trono pass&#242; al suo giovane figlio, Edoardo. A quindici anni Elisabetta venne coinvolta in un complotto per rovesciarlo. In seguito, rischi&#242; l'esecuzione per tradimento, alla quale sopravvisse convincendo i suoi scettici interrogatori che non aveva niente a che fare con il complotto.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alla morte di re Edoardo, nel 1553, sua sorella maggiore Mary sal&#236; al trono. Una cattolica convinta, Mary risult&#242; impopolare a diversi nobili protestanti, che cercarono senza successo di rovesciarla nel 1554. Ancora una volta, Elisabetta venne implicata, ma riusc&#236; nuovamente ad evitare l'esecuzione.[PARAGRAPH:2]La regina Mary mor&#236; nel 1558 ed Elisabetta divenne infine regina, dimostrandosi un'eccellente governatore. Istitu&#236; la Chiesa Protestante come religione ufficiale d'Inghilterra, ma al tempo stesso lott&#242; contro la persecuzione dei cattolici all'interno del paese... per quanto le fu possibile, visto che i nobili cattolici tramavano alle sua spalle per rovesciarla. Riusc&#236; inoltre a rinsaldare la svalutata moneta Inglese e rese il paese un importante centro culturale, nel quale fiorirono artisti come William Shakespeare.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elisabetta us&#242; tutti gli strumenti a sua disposizione per raggiungere i propri obiettivi: ricevette numerose offerte di matrimonio da nobili e re di tutta Europa, ma non ne accett&#242; nessuna, sfruttando la sua condizione celibe per controllare in uguale misura amici e nemici. Se una fazione cominciava a diventare troppo potente, poteva rimetterla in riga lasciando intendere che stava considerando il matrimonio con un rappresentante della fazione opposta.[PARAGRAPH:2]Militarmente, la Spagna Cattolica era la minaccia principale: la Spagna, infatti, era la pi&#249; grande potenza continentale dell'epoca e il suo leader, re Filippo, aveva pi&#249; volte espresso l'intenzione di invadere l'Inghilterra. Ci prov&#242; nel 1588, costruendo un'enorme armata per conquistare la crescente nazione inglese, ma Elisabetta organizz&#242; rapidamente la flotta nazionale e, grazie ad una combinazione di tattiche superiori, di progettazione navale e al tempo inclemente, riusc&#236; a respingere il nemico. L'Inghilterra non venne minacciata di invasione per i 400 anni successivi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elisabetta mor&#236; nel 1603, lasciando il paese in condizioni molto migliori rispetto al suo insediamento. Le parole che meglio la descrivono sono le sue: "So di avere il corpo di una debole e fragile donna, ma ho il cuore e il fegato di un re".</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Frederick[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Prussia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] January 24, 1712 - August 17, 1786 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Frederick was born to Frederick William I, the tyrannical and cultured King of Prussia. The king held his son in great contempt, despising him for his lack of interest in leadership and war; the younger Frederick instead preferred to study literature and the arts. At the age of 18 Frederick attempted to flee to England, but he was captured and brought back to his extremely angry father, who forced him to watch the beheading of his close friend and accomplice, Lieutenant Katz. He apparently was able to get back into his father's good graces, and several years later he married a German noblewoman at his father's request. [PARAGRAPH:2]For the next several years Frederick enjoyed the life of a wealthy man of letters. He maintained an active correspondence with various scholars from around Europe, including the brilliant French writer; Voltaire. He wrote "Anti-Machiavel," a lively refutation of Machiavelli's; "The Prince." Frederick assumed the throne of Prussia upon his father's death in 1740. [PARAGRAPH:2]Once in power, Frederick showed himself to be both a ruthless pragmatist and a brilliant campaigner. Seeking to increase the size of his empire, over the next 23 years he fought a series of wars against his neighbors, notably Austria, who was often allied with Russia and France. With the support of England he won a series of significant battles against his foes, but he was eventually worn down and soundly defeated, and Berlin was occupied by an allied Austrian-Russian army. [PARAGRAPH:2]Reportedly on the verge of suicide, Frederick was saved by the timely death of the Russian Tsarina, who was replaced by the pro-Prussian Peter III. Facing the combined power of Russia and Prussia, Austria was forced to accede to Frederick's demands and give up all claims to Upper and Lower Silesia. The two European monarchs then dismembered Poland, making Prussia the most powerful force in Europe for many years to come. [PARAGRAPH:2]Domestically, Frederick was the model of an "enlightened despot." He instituted important legal and penal reforms, created new industries, improved education, and accomplished internal improvements such as drainage projects, roads, and canals. He improved the lot of his own serfs (but did nothing to curtail the nobility's power over them). [PARAGRAPH:2]During his rule Frederick maintained his friendship with the enlightened men of Europe. His midnight soirees in Potsdam were famous for the great men they attracted. Frederick was quite famous for his sharp wit and caustic tongue; he more than held his own in their company.

Celui-ci &#233;prouve un profond m&#233;pris pour son fils, lui reprochant son manque d'int&#233;r&#234;t pour le commandement et la guerre et sa pr&#233;f&#233;rence pour la litt&#233;rature et les arts. A 18 ans, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric tente de fuir en Angleterre mais il est captur&#233; et ramen&#233; &#224; son p&#232;re. Extr&#234;mement m&#233;content, celui-ci l'oblige &#224; assister &#224; la d&#233;capitation de son ami intime et complice, le lieutenant Katte. Il semble qu'il r&#233;ussisse cependant &#224; retrouver les bonnes gr&#226;ces de son p&#232;re et quelques ann&#233;es plus tard, il acc&#232;de &#224; sa demande en &#233;pousant une noble allemande. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pendant les quelques ann&#233;es qui suivent, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric II savoure la vie d'un homme de lettres ais&#233;. Il entretient une riche correspondance avec plusieurs &#233;rudits originaires de toute l'Europe, et notamment le brillant &#233;crivain fran&#231;ais Voltaire. Il r&#233;dige l'"Anti-Machiavel", une vive r&#233;futation du "Prince" de Machiavel. A la mort de son p&#232;re en 1740, il acc&#232;de au tr&#244;ne de Prusse. [PARAGRAPH:2]Une fois au pouvoir, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric II fait preuve d'un grand pragmatisme et s'av&#232;re un brillant chef de campagne. Au cours des 23 ann&#233;es suivantes, il cherche &#224; agrandir son empire et m&#232;ne plusieurs guerres contre ses voisins, et notamment contre l'Autriche, souvent alli&#233;e &#224; la Russie et &#224; la France. Gr&#226;ce au soutien de l'Angleterre, il remporte plusieurs victoires importantes avant d'&#234;tre finalement affaibli et largement battu et de voir Berlin occup&#233;e par une arm&#233;e austro-russe. [PARAGRAPH:2]Selon certaines sources, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric II est au bord du suicide, mais il est sauv&#233; par la mort opportune de la tsarine russe, remplac&#233;e par Pierre III, favorable &#224; la Prusse. Face au pouvoir conjoint de la Russie et de la Prusse, l'Autriche est contrainte d'acc&#233;der aux demandes de Fr&#233;d&#233;ric II et d'abandonner toutes ses pr&#233;tentions sur la Haute et la Basse Sil&#233;sie. Les deux monarques europ&#233;ens d&#233;mant&#232;lent ensuite la Pologne, faisant de la Prusse la plus grande puissance d'Europe pour de nombreuses ann&#233;es. [PARAGRAPH:2]Sur le plan int&#233;rieur, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric II symbolise le "despote &#233;clair&#233;". Il met en place d'importantes r&#233;formes juridiques et p&#233;nales, d&#233;veloppe de nouvelles industries, modernise l'&#233;ducation et construit de nouvelles infrastructures dans le pays, telles que des routes et des canaux, en recourant au drainage.

W&#228;hrend der K&#246;nig seinen Sohn f&#252;r sein milit&#228;risches Desinteresse verachtete, widmete sich dieser der Literatur und den K&#252;nsten. 1730 unternahm er mit seinem Jugendfreund Hans Hermann von Katte einen Fluchtversuch. Dieser wurde jedoch vereitelt und beide wurden in der Festung K&#252;strin inhaftiert. Dort wurde Katte schlie&#223;lich vor den Augen Friedrichs II. enthauptet. Auf Druck seines Vaters heiratete Friedrich die deutsche Adlige Elisabeth Christine von Braunschweig-Bevern. [PARAGRAPH:2]In den folgenden Jahren genoss Friedrich sein Leben als reicher Intellektueller. Er stand in regem Kontakt mit Voltaire und verfasste 1740 sein "Anti-Macchiavell", in dem er Machiavellis staatspolitische Grunds&#228;tze kritisch analysierte. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters im Jahr 1740 bestieg Friedrich schlie&#223;lich den preu&#223;ischen Thron. [PARAGRAPH:2]Unmittelbar nach Amtsantritt erwies sich Friedrich als r&#252;cksichtsloser Pragmatiker und begnadeter Soldat. Unter seiner F&#252;hrung begann Preu&#223;en zahlreiche Kriege (meist gegen &#214;sterreich) und etablierte sich auf diese Weise neben Frankreich, England, &#214;sterreich und Russland als f&#252;nfte Gro&#223;macht Europas. [PARAGRAPH:2]Friedrich trug sich ob seiner politischen Isolation lange Zeit mit Selbstmordgedanken. Nach dem Tod der Zarin Elisabeth schloss deren Neffe allerdings einen Sonderfrieden mit Preu&#223;en. Nach der letzten gro&#223;en Schlacht zwischen &#214;sterreich und Preu&#223;en bei Freiberg musste &#214;sterreich angesichts der russisch-preu&#223;ischen Allianz auf seine schlesischen Besitzungen verzichten. Nach der Teilung Polens war Preu&#223;en endg&#252;ltig eine der f&#252;hrenden europ&#228;ischen Gro&#223;m&#228;chte. [PARAGRAPH:2]Innenpolitisch war Friedrich ein "aufgekl&#228;rter Despot". Er rief bedeutende Rechtsreformen ins Leben, f&#246;rderte die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung Preu&#223;ens und belebte die Landwirtschaft durch gro&#223; angelegte Trockenlegungen zur Gewinnung landwirtschaftlicher Nutzfl&#228;chen. Die kurz vor seinem Tod angesto&#223;enen Rechtsreformen erm&#246;glichten sp&#228;ter die Befreiung der Bauern aus der Leibeigenschaft. [PARAGRAPH:2]W&#228;hrend seiner Regentschaft pflegte Friedrich die Freundschaft zu den gebildeten M&#228;nnern Europas. Seine mittern&#228;chtlichen Treffen in Potsdam waren ber&#252;hmt.

Il re disprezzava apertamente suo figlio, disdegnando il suo disinteresse per il comando e la guerra: il giovane Federico, invece, preferiva lo studio della letteratura e dell'arte. All'et&#224; di 18 anni, Federico tent&#242; di fuggire in Inghilterra, ma venne catturato e riportato dal padre, il quale, profondamente adirato, lo costrinse ad assistere alla decapitazione del suo miglior amico e complice, il tenente Katz. Federico apparentemente riusc&#236; a riconquistare la stima del padre, e diversi anni dopo spos&#242; una nobildonna tedesca sotto richiesta del re.[PARAGRAPH:2]Negli anni successivi, Federico visse una vita da benestante uomo di cultura, mantenendo un'attiva corrispondenza con gli studiosi di tutta Europa, incluso il brillante scrittore francese Voltaire. Scrisse "L'anti-Macchiavelli", un'accesa contestazione de "Il Principe" di Macchiavelli. Alla morte del padre, nel 1740, Federico sal&#236; al trono di Prussia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Una volta al potere, Federico si dimostr&#242; un feroce pragmatista e un brillante combattente: con l'obiettivo di espandere il proprio impero, nei 23 anni successivi affront&#242; una serie di guerre contro i suoi vicini, tra cui l'Austria, spesso alleata con la Russia e la Francia. Con il supporto dell'Inghilterra vinse una serie di battaglie significative contro i suoi nemici, ma venne infine sconfitto e Berlino fu occupata da un esercito Austriaco-Russo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sull'orlo del suicidio, Federico fu salvato dalla provvidenziale morte della zarina Russa, a cui successe il pro-Prussiano Pietro III. Dovendo affrontare le forze combinate di Russia e Prussia, l'Austria fu costretta ad acconsentire alle richieste di Federico e a cedere la Silesia Inferiore e Superiore. In seguito i due monarchi europei smembrarono la Polonia, rendendo la Prussia la forza pi&#249; potente d'Europa per molti anni a venire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Per quanto riguarda la politica interna, Federico fu un "despota illuminato" modello: istitu&#236; importanti riforme legali e penali, cre&#242; nuove industrie, miglior&#242; l'educazione e svilupp&#242; diversi miglioramenti interni, come i progetti di bonifiche, strate e canali. Miglior&#242; le condizioni dei terreni dei suoi servi, ma non fece niente per ridurre il potere della nobilt&#224; su di essi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Durante il suo governo, Federico mantenne la propria amicizia con molti uomini illuminati d'Europa. Le sue feste di mezzanotte a Potsdam erano famose per la grandezza degli ospiti che attirava. Federico era anche famoso per la sua prontezza di spirito e per la sua lingua tagliente.[PARAGRAPH:2]Federico mor&#236; nel 1768, lasciando la Prussia pi&#249; potente e prospera rispetto a quando aveva ottenuto il potere. Alla sua morte, il nipote di Federico, Federico Guglielmo II, eredit&#242; il trono di Prussia.</Italian>

The king held his son in great contempt, despising him for his lack of interest in leadership and war; the younger Frederick instead preferred to study literature and the arts. At the age of 18 Frederick attempted to flee to England, but he was captured and brought back to his extremely angry father, who forced him to watch the beheading of his close friend and accomplice, Lieutenant Katz. He apparently was able to get back into his father's good graces, and several years later he married a German noblewoman at his father's request. [PARAGRAPH:2]For the next several years Frederick enjoyed the life of a wealthy man of letters. He maintained an active correspondence with various scholars from around Europe, including the brilliant French writer; Voltaire. He wrote "Anti-Machiavel," a lively refutation of Machiavelli's; "The Prince." Frederick assumed the throne of Prussia upon his father's death in 1740. [PARAGRAPH:2]Once in power, Frederick showed himself to be both a ruthless pragmatist and a brilliant campaigner. Seeking to increase the size of his empire, over the next 23 years he fought a series of wars against his neighbors, notably Austria, who was often allied with Russia and France. With the support of England he won a series of significant battles against his foes, but he was eventually worn down and soundly defeated, and Berlin was occupied by an allied Austrian-Russian army. [PARAGRAPH:2]Reportedly on the verge of suicide, Frederick was saved by the timely death of the Russian Tsarina, who was replaced by the pro-Prussian Peter III. Facing the combined power of Russia and Prussia, Austria was forced to accede to Frederick's demands and give up all claims to Upper and Lower Silesia. The two European monarchs then dismembered Poland, making Prussia the most powerful force in Europe for many years to come. [PARAGRAPH:2]Domestically, Frederick was the model of an "enlightened despot."

		<English>[H1]Peter the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 9, 1672 - February 8, 1725 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Peter was born the fourth son of the Tsar Alexey I. After the death of his father and older brother, at the age of 10 he became co-tsar with his sickly half-brother, Ivan, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alexeevna. Apparently Peter was quite the terror in his teens. He had utter contempt for religious and political ceremony, combined with almost limitless energy and a capacity for alcohol. At 17 he had the regent (his elder sister) arrested on charges of conspiring against him and had her locked in a convent, where she would stay for the rest of her life. He took total control of the empire, his brother Ivan no more than a figurehead. [PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to drinking, carousing, and political intrigue, young Peter was also fascinated by military affairs. In 1695, he ordered the army to move against the Turks. Astonishingly, he didn't command his forces in the field, instead choosing to act as an lowly artilleryman. The Russian forces emerged victorious and within a year had captured the vital port of Azov. [PARAGRAPH:2]Several years later, Peter set off on a tour of Europe. He spent 16 months traveling incognito through Germany, Holland, England and Austria, at one time working as a shipwright in England and Holland. Peter learned a lot during his trip, and he later hired many western craftsmen, engineers, soldiers, sailors, architects and artists to help modernize Russia. Once home, Peter adopted many European customs, including a mandate that beards were to be shaved off at court, which was a great controversy that nearly caused a revolt with the Boyars. [PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his love of European culture, Peter remained a drunken, overbearing bully, whose practical jokes stopped just short of outright torture. (Or perhaps went a little over the line.) Foreign observers noted with horror that at a state dinner Peter had one of his cronies hold another tight, pinning his arms and forcing his mouth open. The victim was known to hate salads and especially vinegar; Peter jammed salad into his mouth and down his throat and then poured vinegar up his nose until it bled. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter liked to force his guests - including foreign diplomats - to drink until they passed out, then wake them up an hour later and force them to drink more. He once woke a group of extremely inebriated men up in the middle of the night, gave them axes and demanded that they help him cut down trees to make a path to the seashore. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1700 Russia went to war against Sweden. But, Gustavus Aldolphus, the Swedish King, proved more cunning to him, striking Peter's army before it was prepared, capturing much of the Russian artillery in the process. In response Peter demanded that all of the bells in Moscow (including church bells) be melted down to make cannons. He also confiscated church treasure to fuel the war effort. The war dragged on, but in 1709 the Swedish forces were decisively defeated, and Russia gained parts of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter's home life did not go particularly well. In 1698 his wife was implicated in a plot to overthrow him; he divorced her and sent her off to yet another convent. In 1712 he married his mistress, Martha Skavronsky, a former Lithuanian servant and previously the mistress of a bevey of other Russian nobles. She gave him four children. In 1718 the tsar's oldest son Alexey was imprisoned for suspected treason and died under torture. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his death Peter was buried in Saint Petersburg, the vital port and Russian capital, which he established in 1703, in the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Presumably under the heaviest rock they could find.</English>

A 10 ans, &#224; la mort de son p&#232;re et de son fr&#232;re a&#238;n&#233;, il dirige conjointement le royaume avec son demi-fr&#232;re malade, Ivan, sous la r&#233;gence de leur soeur Sophia Alekse&#239;evna. Il semble que Pierre le Grand ait &#233;t&#233; d'un temp&#233;rament tr&#232;s difficile au cours de son adolescence. Il m&#233;prise profond&#233;ment les c&#233;r&#233;monies religieuses et politiques, regorge d'une &#233;nergie illimit&#233;e et r&#233;siste particuli&#232;rement bien &#224; l'alcool. A 17 ans, il fait arr&#234;ter la r&#233;gente (sa soeur a&#238;n&#233;e) qu'il accuse de conspiration &#224; son encontre et la fait enfermer au couvent o&#249; elle restera jusqu'&#224; la fin de ses jours. Il prend enti&#232;rement le contr&#244;le de l'empire, son fr&#232;re Ivan n'ayant qu'un r&#244;le honorifique. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le jeune Pierre Ier n'est pas seulement attir&#233; par la boisson, les noces et les intrigues politiques, il est &#233;galement fascin&#233; par les affaires militaires. En 1695, il ordonne &#224; son arm&#233;e de marcher contre les Turcs. Contre toute attente il pr&#233;f&#232;re un poste de combat, en tant que soldat d'artillerie l&#233;g&#232;re, &#224; un poste de commandement. Les forces russes l'emportent et en l'espace d'une ann&#233;e, elles s'emparent du port d'Azov, acc&#232;s vital pour le pays. [PARAGRAPH:2]Quelques ann&#233;es plus tard, Pierre le Grand part faire un tour d'Europe. Il passe 16 mois incognito en Allemagne, en Hollande, en Angleterre et en Autriche, travaillant chez un constructeur naval en Angleterre puis en Hollande. Il tire une grande exp&#233;rience de ce voyage et engage ult&#233;rieurement de nombreux artisans, ing&#233;nieurs, soldats, marins, architectes et artistes occidentaux pour participer &#224; la modernisation de la Russie. De retour au pays, Pierre le Grand adopte de nombreuses coutumes europ&#233;ennes, obligeant notamment les membres de la cour &#224; se raser la barbe, ce qui provoque une grave controverse d&#233;bouchant presque sur une r&#233;volte des boyards. [PARAGRAPH:2]En d&#233;pit de son amour de la culture europ&#233;enne, Pierre le Grand reste un tyran dominateur et ivre, dont les distractions peuvent tourner &#224; la torture. Lors d'un grand d&#238;ner, des observateurs &#233;trangers assistent avec horreur &#224; un v&#233;ritable supplice. En effet, Pierre le Grand demande &#224; l'un de ses amis de maintenir fermement l'un des convives, la bouche ouverte. Sachant que la victime d&#233;teste la salade et notamment le vinaigre, Pierre le Grand lui bourre la bouche et la gorge de salade, puis y verse du vinaigre jusqu'&#224; ce que sa victime saigne du nez. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pierre le Grand aime pousser ses convives, y compris les diplomates &#233;trangers, &#224; l'abus d'alcool. Pour le seul plaisir de les laisser ivres morts, puis de les r&#233;veiller une heure plus tard et de les obliger &#224; boire &#224; nouveau. Une fois, il r&#233;veille au milieu de la nuit un groupe d'hommes compl&#232;tement so&#251;ls, leur donne des haches et leur demande de l'aider &#224; abattre les arbres pour se frayer un chemin jusqu'au rivage. [PARAGRAPH:2]En 1700, la Russie entre en guerre contre la Su&#232;de, mais Charles XII se montre plus astucieux : il surprend l'arm&#233;e de Pierre le Grand et saisit une grande partie de l'artillerie russe au cours de la bataille. En r&#233;ponse, Pierre exige que toutes les cloches de Moscou (y compris celles des &#233;glises) soient fondues pour fabriquer des canons. Il confisque alors les tr&#233;sors du clerg&#233; pour alimenter l'effort de guerre. La guerre se prolonge, mais les forces su&#233;doises sont enti&#232;rement d&#233;faites et la Russie prend possession de territoires en Finlande, en Estonie et en Lituanie. [PARAGRAPH:2]La vie priv&#233;e de Pierre le Grand n'est pas v&#233;ritablement exemplaire. En 1698, sa femme est impliqu&#233;e dans un complot visant &#224; le renverser ; il divorce et l'envoie elle aussi dans un couvent. En 1712, il &#233;pouse sa ma&#238;tresse Martha Skavronskaya, une ancienne servante lituanienne qui a autrefois connu d'autres aventures avec de nobles russes. Elle prend le nom de Catherine I&#232;re et lui donne quatre enfants.

Nach dem Tod seines Vaters im Jahr 1682 herrschten Peter und sein &#228;lterer Bruder Iwan V. (bis zu dessen Tod 1696) gemeinsam &#252;ber das Land. Die Regierungsgesch&#228;fte leitete zun&#228;chst Peters Schwester Sophia Alexeevna. Peter war ein schwieriges Kind, das religi&#246;se und politische Zeremonien verachtete und dem Alkohol zusprach. Als 17-j&#228;hriger lie&#223; er seine Schwester als angebliche Verr&#228;terin verhaften und in ein Kloster verbannen, in dem sie den Rest ihres Lebens verbringen sollte. Peter war nun der uneingeschr&#228;nkte Herrscher Russlands. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter interessierte sich vor allem f&#252;r Trinkgelage, politischen Intrigen und das Milit&#228;r. 1695 ordnete er den Angriff auf die T&#252;rkei an. W&#228;hrend des Feldzuges diente Peter (sehr zur &#220;berraschung seiner Gener&#228;le) als einfacher Artillerist. Ein Jahr sp&#228;ter eroberte die russische Armee den Hafen von Azov. [PARAGRAPH:2]Einige Jahre sp&#228;ter begab sich Peter auf eine Reise durch ganz Europa. Er reiste 16 Monate lang inkognito durch Deutschland, Holland, England und &#214;sterreich und arbeitete angeblich sogar auf englischen und holl&#228;ndischen Schiffswerften. Nach seiner R&#252;ckkehr leitete Peter verschiedene Reformen nach westlichem Vorbild ein, um Russland zu modernisieren. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter blieb zeitlebens ein Tyrann, dessen Scherze oft an Folter grenzten. W&#228;hrend eines Staatsbanketts soll er einem Freund, der Essig verabscheute, Essig in die Nase gegossen haben, bis diese zu bluten begann. [PARAGRAPH:2]G&#228;ste und ausl&#228;ndischen Diplomaten zwang Peter oft, bis zur Bewusstlosigkeit zu trinken. [PARAGRAPH:2]Im Gro&#223;en Nordischen Krieg ab 1700 konnte Peter die Schweden unter ihrem jungen K&#246;nig Karl XII. nach anf&#228;nglichen R&#252;ckschl&#228;gen schlie&#223;lich zur&#252;ckdr&#228;ngen. Als die Schweden die russische Artillerie &#252;berraschten und gefangen nahmen, lie&#223; Peter aus Kirchenglocken neue Kanonen gie&#223;en. Um den Krieg finanzieren zu k&#246;nnen, konfiszierte Peter Kirchensch&#228;tze. In der Schlacht bei Poltawa konnten die russischen Truppen die Schweden am 8. Juli 1709 schlie&#223;lich vernichtend schlagen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peters Privatleben verlief weniger erfolgreich. 1698 war seine erste Frau in einen Komplott gegen Peter verstrickt. Dieser lie&#223; sich daraufhin scheiden und verbannte seine Frau in ein Kloster. 1712 heiratete er seine Geliebte Martha Skavronsky, die ihm vier Kinder schenkte. 1718 bezichtigte Peter seinen &#228;ltesten Sohn Alexei der Verschw&#246;rung, lie&#223; ihn gefangen nehmen und zu Tode foltern.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach seinem Tod wurde Peter in der Peter und Paul Kathedrale in Sankt Petersburg (das Peter im Jahr 1703 gegr&#252;ndet hatte) begraben.</German>

Alla morte del padre e del fratello maggiore, all'et&#224; di soli 10 anni, divenne zar insieme al fratellastro malato, Ivan, sotto la reggenza della sorella Sofia Alexeevna. Apparentemente, Pietro era un vero terrore da giovane: aveva un completo disprezzo per le cerimonie religiose e politiche, combinato con un'energia quasi infinita e una grande tolleranza all'alcol. A 17 anni fece arrestare la reggente (sua sorella maggiore) con l'accusa di cospirazione e la fece rinchiudere in convento, dove rimase per il resto della sua vita. Essendo Ivan una semplice figura di rappresentanza, prese su di s&#233; il controllo totale dell'impero.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oltre dai vizi del bere, del fare baldoria e dagli intrighi politici, il giovane Pietro era affascinato dagli affari militari: nel 1695, ordin&#242; all'esercito di attaccare i Turchi. Sorprendentemente, non comand&#242; le proprie forze sul campo, ma scelse di prestare servizio nell'artiglieria. L'esercito russo usc&#236; vincitore e, entro un anno, cattur&#242; il vitale porto di Azov.[PARAGRAPH:2]Diversi anni pi&#249; tardi, Pietro part&#236; per un viaggio in Europa, dove trascorse 16 mesi viaggiando in incognito attraverso Germania, Olanda, Inghilterra e Austria, lavorando anche come carpentiere navale. Pietro impar&#242; molto dal suo viaggio e pi&#249; tardi assold&#242; molti artigiani, ingegneri, marinai, architetti e artisti occidentali per aiutarlo a modernizzare la Russia. Una volta a casa, Pietro adott&#242; molte usanze europee, incluso il costume di rasare la barba a corte, una grande controversia che quasi caus&#242; la rivolta dei Boyar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nonostante il suo amore per la cultura europea, Pietro rimase un ubriacone e un prepotente, i cui rozzi scherzi sfioravano la tortura (o ne superavano il labile confine). Gli osservatori stranieri annotarono con orrore come, durante un pranzo di stato, Pietro costrinse un amico a tenerne fermo un altro, aprendogli la bocca: la vittima era nota per odiare l'insalata e, specialmente, l'aceto... Pietro gli riemp&#236; la bocca d'insalata e gli vers&#242; in gola tanto aceto, che il suo naso cominci&#242; a sanguinare.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pietro amava costringere i suoi ospiti, compresi i diplomatici stranieri, a bere fino allo sfinimento, per poi svegliarli qualche ora dopo per costringerli a bere ancora. Una volta svegli&#242; un gruppo di uomini incredibilmente ubriachi nel mezzo della notte, gli mise in pugno delle scuri e ordin&#242; che lo aiutassero a tagliare gli alberi per creare una strada fino alla spiaggia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel 1700, la Russia entr&#242; in guerra con la Svezia, ma Gustavus Aldolphus, il re Svedese, si dimostr&#242; pi&#249; astuto, colpendo l'esercito di Pietro prima che avesse il tempo di organizzarsi e catturando gran parte della sua artiglieria. In risposta, Pietro ordin&#242; che tutte le campane di Mosca, incluse quelle delle chiese, venissero fuse per creare nuovi cannoni. Inoltre, confisc&#242; i tesori delle chiese per coprire le spese della guerra, che si protrasse a lungo. Nel 1709, l'esercito svedese venne definitivamente sconfitto e la Russia ottenne parte della Finlandia, dell'Estonia e della Lettonia.[PARAGRAPH:2]La vita domestica di Pietro non and&#242; particolarmente bene: nel 1698, sua moglie venne implicata nel complotto per rovesciarlo. Dopo aver divorziato, la rinchiuse in un altro convento. Nel 1712 spos&#242; la sua amante, Marta Skavronsky, una ex-serva lituana ed ex-amante di altri nobili russi, la quale diede alla luce quattro figli. Nel 1718, il figlio maggiore dello zar, Alexey, venne imprigionato per sospetto tradimento e mor&#236; sotto tortura.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alla sua morte, Pietro venne sepolto a San Pietroburgo, porto vitale e capitale della Russia fatta costruire per sua volont&#224;, nella Cattedrale di Pietro e Paul. Presumibilmente, sotto la roccia pi&#249; pensante che riuscirono a trovare.</Italian>

Seg&#250;n parece, Pedro era un adolescente terrible. Sent&#237;a un total desprecio por el ceremonial religioso y pol&#237;tico, combinado con una energ&#237;a casi inagotable y una propensi&#243;n a la bebida. A los 17 a&#241;os hizo arrestar a la regente (su hermana mayor) por conspirar contra &#233;l y la hizo encerrar en un convento, donde pasar&#237;a el resto de su vida. As&#237; se hizo con el control total del imperio, sin que su hermano Iv&#225;n fuera otra cosa que una figura de paja. [PARAGRAPH:2]Adem&#225;s de su aprecio por la bebida, la juerga y las intrigas pol&#237;ticas, el joven Pedro sent&#237;a una aut&#233;ntica fascinaci&#243;n por las cuestiones militares. En 1695, orden&#243; que el ej&#233;rcito atacara a los turcos Para sorpresa de todos, en lugar de dirigirlo, decidi&#243; actuar como simple soldado de artiller&#237;a. Las fuerzas rusas salieron victoriosas, y en menos de un a&#241;o hab&#237;an logrado capturar el vital puerto de Azov. [PARAGRAPH:2]Varios a&#241;os despu&#233;s, Pedro emprendi&#243; un viaje por toda Europa. Pas&#243; 16 meses viajando de inc&#243;gnito por Alemania, Holanda, Inglaterra y Austria, e incluso, en una ocasi&#243;n, trabaj&#243; como calafate en Inglaterra y Holanda. Este viaje le ense&#241;&#243; mucho, y m&#225;s tarde contratar&#237;a a muchos artesanos, ingenieros, soldados, marineros, arquitectos y artistas europeos para que lo ayudaran a modernizar Rusia. Una vez en su hogar, adopt&#243; muchas costumbres europeas, como por ejemplo la prohibici&#243;n de las barbas en la corte, que fue causa de mucha controversia y estuvo a punto de provocar una revuelta de los boyardos. [PARAGRAPH:2]A pesar de su aprecio por la cultura europea, Pedro sigui&#243; siento un borracho y un pendenciero insoportable, cuyas bromas rayaban la tortura (o llegaban a serlo). Un observador extranjero cont&#243; con horror que, en una ocasi&#243;n, durante una cena de estado, Pedro hizo que uno de sus cortesanos inmovilizara a otro sujet&#225;ndolo por los brazos y le obligara a abrir la boca. La aversi&#243;n que a la v&#237;ctima le provocaban las ensaladas, y especialmente el vinagre, era bien conocida; Pedro le llen&#243; la boca de ensalada y a continuaci&#243;n derram&#243; vinagre en su nariz hasta hacerle sangrar. [PARAGRAPH:2]A Pedro le gustaba obligar a sus invitados, diplom&#225;ticos extranjeros incluidos, a beber hasta perder el conocimiento, y luego despertarlos una hora m&#225;s tarde y obligarlos a seguir bebiendo. En una ocasi&#243;n despert&#243; a un grupo de hombres extremadamente borrachos, les entreg&#243; unas hachas y les orden&#243; que cortaran &#225;rboles para hacer un camino hasta la costa. [PARAGRAPH:2]En 1700, Rusia entr&#243; en guerra con Suecia. Pero Carlos XII, el joven rey de esta &#250;ltima, con tan solo 16 a&#241;os, demostr&#243; m&#225;s astucia que &#233;l y atac&#243; a las fuerzas de Pedro antes de que estuvieran preparadas, consiguiendo capturar buena parte de su artiller&#237;a. Como respuesta, Pedro orden&#243; que se fundieran todas las campanas de Mosc&#250; (incluidas las de las iglesias) para hacer ca&#241;ones. Tambi&#233;n confisc&#243; el tesoro de la Iglesia para financiar la guerra. El conflicto dur&#243; hasta 1709, pero las fuerzas suecas sufrieron una derrota decisiva, y Rusia obtuvo zonas de Finlandia, Estonia y Letonia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Su vida personal no fue demasiado bien. En 1698, al descubrir que su esposa estaba implicada en un complot para derrocarlo, se divorci&#243; y la envi&#243; a otro convento.

		<Portuguese>[H1]Peter the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 9, 1672 - February 8, 1725 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Peter was born the fourth son of the Tsar Alexey I. After the death of his father and older brother, at the age of 10 he became co-tsar with his sickly half-brother, Ivan, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alexeevna. Apparently Peter was quite the terror in his teens. He had utter contempt for religious and political ceremony, combined with almost limitless energy and a capacity for alcohol. At 17 he had the regent (his elder sister) arrested on charges of conspiring against him and had her locked in a convent, where she would stay for the rest of her life. He took total control of the empire, his brother Ivan no more than a figurehead. [PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to drinking, carousing, and political intrigue, young Peter was also fascinated by military affairs. In 1695, he ordered the army to move against the Turks. Astonishingly, he didn't command his forces in the field, instead choosing to act as an lowly artilleryman. The Russian forces emerged victorious and within a year had captured the vital port of Azov. [PARAGRAPH:2]Several years later, Peter set off on a tour of Europe. He spent 16 months traveling incognito through Germany, Holland, England and Austria, at one time working as a shipwright in England and Holland. Peter learned a lot during his trip, and he later hired many western craftsmen, engineers, soldiers, sailors, architects and artists to help modernize Russia. Once home, Peter adopted many European customs, including a mandate that beards were to be shaved off at court, which was a great controversy that nearly caused a revolt with the Boyars. [PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his love of European culture, Peter remained a drunken, overbearing bully, whose practical jokes stopped just short of outright torture. (Or perhaps went a little over the line.) Foreign observers noted with horror that at a state dinner Peter had one of his cronies hold another tight, pinning his arms and forcing his mouth open. The victim was known to hate salads and especially vinegar; Peter jammed salad into his mouth and down his throat and then poured vinegar up his nose until it bled. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter liked to force his guests - including foreign diplomats - to drink until they passed out, then wake them up an hour later and force them to drink more. He once woke a group of extremely inebriated men up in the middle of the night, gave them axes and demanded that they help him cut down trees to make a path to the seashore. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1700 Russia went to war against Sweden. But, Gustavus Aldolphus, the Swedish King, proved more cunning to him, striking Peter's army before it was prepared, capturing much of the Russian artillery in the process. In response Peter demanded that all of the bells in Moscow (including church bells) be melted down to make cannons. He also confiscated church treasure to fuel the war effort. The war dragged on, but in 1709 the Swedish forces were decisively defeated, and Russia gained parts of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Peter's home life did not go particularly well. In 1698 his wife was implicated in a plot to overthrow him; he divorced her and sent her off to yet another convent. In 1712 he married his mistress, Martha Skavronsky, a former Lithuanian servant and previously the mistress of a bevey of other Russian nobles. She gave him four children. In 1718 the tsar's oldest son Alexey was imprisoned for suspected treason and died under torture. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his death Peter was buried in Saint Petersburg, the vital port and Russian capital, which he established in 1703, in the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Presumably under the heaviest rock they could find.</Portuguese>

At 16 she was married to Carl Peter Ulrich, the heir to the Russian throne. Catherine quickly learned Russian and joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Largely self-educated, Catherine immersed herself in the literature of the time. Endowed with both beauty and intelligence, she became strong friends (if not more) with the great thinkers of the day, including the brilliant French philosophers Rousseau and Diderot.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine did not lack political ambition, however. At the age of 33, with the support of the Imperial guard, she overthrew her husband, the Emperor Peter III, who was soon killed "in a hunting accident," leaving Catherine the sole ruler of Russia. As Empress, Catherine pursued an expansionist policy, fighting two successful wars against the Ottoman Empire and acquiring vast territory in southern Ukraine and the Crimea. She undertook a wide range of political reforms, attempting to shape up the notoriously corrupt and incompetent Russian bureaucracy. She curried favor with the aristocracy, expanding their already-great power over the Russian peasants.[PARAGRAPH:2]A patron of the arts, Catherine commissioned many statues and paintings. Under her rule St. Petersburg was transformed from a primitive and forbidding city into one of the most beautiful and impressive European capitals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite her many public successes, Catherine is best known for her private excesses. Her affairs are legendary; it has been suggested that she slept with a fairly large fraction of the Russian officers corps, not to mention her many well-publicized dalliances with a horde of well-known European politicians and artists.[NEWLINE]Catherine died at the age of 67, having lived longer than any other Romanov monarch. </English>

		<Portuguese>[H1]Catherine the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tsarina of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 2, 1729 - November 17, 1796 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Catherine was born in Szczecin in 1729, a princess of Pomerania, a small kingdom in Prussia. At 16 she was married to Carl Peter Ulrich, the heir to the Russian throne. Catherine quickly learned Russian and joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Largely self-educated, Catherine immersed herself in the literature of the time. Endowed with both beauty and intelligence, she became strong friends (if not more) with the great thinkers of the day, including the brilliant French philosophers Rousseau and Diderot.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine did not lack political ambition, however. At the age of 33, with the support of the Imperial guard, she overthrew her husband, the Emperor Peter III, who was soon killed "in a hunting accident," leaving Catherine the sole ruler of Russia. As Empress, Catherine pursued an expansionist policy, fighting two successful wars against the Ottoman Empire and acquiring vast territory in southern Ukraine and the Crimea. She undertook a wide range of political reforms, attempting to shape up the notoriously corrupt and incompetent Russian bureaucracy. She curried favor with the aristocracy, expanding their already-great power over the Russian peasants.[PARAGRAPH:2]A patron of the arts, Catherine commissioned many statues and paintings. Under her rule St. Petersburg was transformed from a primitive and forbidding city into one of the most beautiful and impressive European capitals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite her many public successes, Catherine is best known for her private excesses. Her affairs are legendary; it has been suggested that she slept with a fairly large fraction of the Russian officers corps, not to mention her many well-publicized dalliances with a horde of well-known European politicians and artists.[NEWLINE]Catherine died at the age of 67, having lived longer than any other Romanov monarch. </Portuguese>

		<English>[H1]Isabella [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Spain[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 22, 1451 - November 26, 1504 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Isabella was the daughter of King John II of Castile. At the time of her birth, Spain was divided into a number of smaller kingdoms, with Castile, Portugal and Aragon being three of the largest. The southern part of the country was under Arab rule, the "Moors" having conquered much of Spain in the 8th Century. For Christian Spain, there were two major objectives: unite the country and drive out the Moors. Isabella accomplished both. [PARAGRAPH:2]After her father's death, Castile was ruled by Isabella's older brother, King Henry IV. At eighteen, and against her brother's express wishes, Isabella married Prince Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Aragon. Henry was furious at her - he had wanted her to marry the King of Portugal - but eventually he forgave her and made Isabella his heir. Upon his death in 1474, Isabella became Queen of Castile, and, after a brief war, made an alliance with Portugal, thus uniting much of Spain. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella and Ferdinand worked surprisingly well together. They co-ruled their two kingdoms equally (according to many historians, Isabella was the better ruler of the two). [PARAGRAPH:2]Once they were enthroned, the couple set about weakening the Spanish nobility, which Isabella believed had become overly powerful. They created a special military force known as the "Holy Brotherhood" for the express purpose of protecting people and property from attacks by the nobility. They also redistributed some of the nobles' lands and destroyed several of their castles. In other internal matters, Isabella and Ferdinand reorganized the courts and the justice system, and they more closely regulated the country's coinage. [PARAGRAPH:2]Some of Isabella and Ferdinand's other programs were less appealing. The two rulers were Catholic zealots and they had a rabid hatred for non-Catholics, and especially for Jews. In 1478 they petitioned the Pope to establish the Spanish Inquisition. Under Chief Inquisitor Torquemada, the Inquisition tortured and murdered thousands across Spain, driving the heretics out of the country or underground, or forcing them to convert to Catholicism. [PARAGRAPH:2]Interestingly, when they conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, Isabella and Ferdinand treated those Muslims quite well, allowing them to freely practice their religion in Spain. The Jews of Granada, however, were treated as barbarously as their cousins in other parts of Spain. [PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps Isabella's most famous act as monarch was her decision to fund Columbus's voyages of exploration. Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who was looking for a western route to India; after getting Isabella's backing, he set out to cross the Atlantic to find Asia. Instead, Columbus discovered America. [PARAGRAPH:2]As a ruler, her record is mixed. She did unite her country along with the help of her husband, Ferdinand. She did drive out foreign powers who had occupied Spain for 700 years. She did bring peace and stability to Spain. She did fund exploration which would bring vast new territory and vast wealth to her kingdom. On the other hand, she did launch a terrible campaign of torture and murder against the most vulnerable population in her lands. To her Christian subjects, then, Isabella probably was the best thing that had ever come their way. However her Jewish subjects probably had a somewhat less positive opinion of Her Majesty. Isabella died in 1504, leaving the kingdom to her daughter.</English>
		<French>[H1]Isabelle la Catholique[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Reine d'Espagne[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dates:[\BOLD] 1451 - 1504[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Isabelle I&#232;re la Catholique est la fille du roi Jean II de Castille. A sa naissance, l'Espagne est divis&#233;e en plusieurs petits royaumes dont les trois plus grands sont la Castille, le Portugal et l'Aragon. La partie sud du pays est sous domination musulmane, les "Maures" ayant conquis une grande partie de l'Espagne au VIIIe si&#232;cle. L'Espagne chr&#233;tienne a deux objectifs principaux, auxquels Isabelle la Catholique parviendra : l'unification du pays et l'expulsion des Maures. [PARAGRAPH:2]A la mort du roi Jean II, la Castille est dirig&#233;e par le fr&#232;re a&#238;n&#233; d'Isabelle, le roi Henri IV. A 18 ans, et contre la volont&#233; explicite de son fr&#232;re, Isabelle la Catholique &#233;pouse le prince Ferdinand, h&#233;ritier du tr&#244;ne d'Aragon. Henri IV est furieux car il la destinait au roi du Portugal, mais il finit par lui pardonner et &#224; faire d'elle son h&#233;riti&#232;re. A sa mort en 1474, Isabelle la Catholique devient reine de Castille et apr&#232;s une br&#232;ve guerre, s'allie avec le Portugal, parvenant ainsi &#224; la quasi unit&#233; de l'Espagne. [PARAGRAPH:2] Isabelle la Catholique et Ferdinand travaillent remarquablement bien ensemble. Ils g&#232;rent conjointement et similairement leurs deux royaumes (selon de nombreux historiens, Isabelle la Catholique semble toutefois meilleure gestionnaire). [PARAGRAPH:2]A son accession au tr&#244;ne, le couple vise &#224; affaiblir la noblesse espagnole car Isabelle la Catholique la juge trop puissante. Ils cr&#233;ent une force arm&#233;e sp&#233;ciale connue sous le nom de "Sainte confr&#233;rie" dont le seul but est de prot&#233;ger les citoyens et leurs biens de la mainmise de la noblesse. Pour ce faire, ils redistribuent certaines terres appartenant &#224; des nobles et d&#233;truisent plusieurs de leurs ch&#226;teaux. Les &#233;poux royaux apportent des am&#233;nagements au sein m&#234;me de leur cours, ils r&#233;organisent le syst&#232;me de justice et surveillent tout particuli&#232;rement le cours de la monnaie du pays. [PARAGRAPH:2]D'autres mesures d'Isabelle la Catholique et Ferdinand sont moins populaires. Les deux souverains sont de fervents catholiques et vouent une haine profonde aux non-catholiques, et notamment aux juifs. En 1478, ils demandent au pape de mettre en place l'Inquisition espagnole. Sous le joug de l'inquisiteur g&#233;n&#233;ral Torquemada, l'Inquisition torture et massacre des milliers de personnes en Espagne, expulsant les h&#233;r&#233;tiques du pays, les contraignant &#224; la clandestinit&#233; ou les obligeant &#224; se convertir au catholicisme. [PARAGRAPH:2]Curieusement, lorsque Isabelle la Catholique et Ferdinand s'emparent de Grenade, le dernier fief musulman d'Espagne, ils traitent avec cl&#233;mence les musulmans, les autorisant &#224; pratiquer librement leur religion en Espagne. En revanche, les juifs de Grenade sont trait&#233;s de mani&#232;re aussi brutale que leurs cousins des autres r&#233;gions d'Espagne. [PARAGRAPH:2]La mesure la plus c&#233;l&#232;bre prise par Isabelle la Catholique en tant que monarque est sans doute sa d&#233;cision de financer les voyages d'exploration de Christophe Colomb, un navigateur italien cherchant une route occidentale vers l'Inde. Apr&#232;s avoir obtenu le soutien d'Isabelle la Catholique, il se pr&#233;pare &#224; traverser l'Atlantique pour atteindre l'Asie. Christophe Colomb d&#233;couvre en fait l'Am&#233;rique. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le bilan d'Isabelle la Catholique en tant que souveraine est mitig&#233;. Elle a unifi&#233; son pays avec l'aide de son mari, a chass&#233; les puissances &#233;trang&#232;res qui occupaient l'Espagne depuis 700 ans et apport&#233; paix et prosp&#233;rit&#233; &#224; l'Espagne. Elle a financ&#233; les explorations qui offriront &#224; son royaume de nouveaux territoires et de nouvelles richesses. Parall&#232;lement, elle a lanc&#233; une terrible campagne de tortures et de meurtres contre la population la plus vuln&#233;rable vivant sur ses terres. Pour les sujets chr&#233;tiens, le r&#232;gne d'Isabelle la Catholique a probablement &#233;t&#233; ce qui pouvait leur arriver de mieux. Cependant, les sujets juifs ont probablement une opinion beaucoup moins positive de sa Majest&#233;. Isabelle la Catholique meurt en 1504, laissant le royaume &#224; sa fille.</French>
		<German>[H1]Isabella[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]K&#246;nigin von Spanien[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1451-1504[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Isabella war die Tochter K&#246;nig Johanns II. von Kastilien und Le&#243;n. Spanien bestand damals aus zahlreichen kleinen K&#246;nigreichen. Die gr&#246;&#223;ten Reiche waren Kastilien, Portugal und Aragon. Der s&#252;dliche Teil des Landes stand unter arabischer Herrschaft, seit die Mauren Spanien im 8. Jahrhundert teilweise erobert hatten. Das christliche Spanien musste also versuchen, das Land zu vereinen und die Mauren zu vertreiben. Isabella gelang beides. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Tod ihres Vaters bestieg Isabellas &#228;lterer Bruder (Heinrich VI.) den Thron. Am 19. Oktober 1469 heiratete Sie (gegen den Willen ihres Bruders) Ferdinand II. von Aragonien und bestieg nach dem Tod ihres Bruders den kastilischen Thron. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella und Ferdinand arbeiteten erstaunlich gut zusammen und herrschten gemeinsam &#252;ber das Reich. [PARAGRAPH:2]Unmittelbar nach der Thronbesteigung begann das Paar mit der Schw&#228;chung des spanischen Adels, der in Isabellas Augen zu m&#228;chtig geworden war. Zu diesem Zweck gr&#252;ndeten sie die "heilige Bruderschaft", die das Volk und dessen Eigentum vor den &#220;bergriffen des Adels sch&#252;tzen sollte. Dar&#252;ber hinaus verteilten sie einen Teil der L&#228;ndereien des Adels neu und lie&#223;en unz&#228;hlige Schl&#246;sser zerst&#246;ren. &#220;berdies veranlassten sie eine Umstrukturierung der Gerichte und des Rechtssystems und verabschiedeten Ma&#223;nahmen zur St&#252;tzung der spanischen W&#228;hrung. [PARAGRAPH:2]Doch es gab auch eine Kehrseite der Medaille. Isabella und Ferdinand waren katholische Eiferer, die alle Andersgl&#228;ubigen (insbesondere die Juden) abgrundtief hassten. 1478 beantragten sie daher beim Papst die spanische Inquisition. Angef&#252;hrt von Generalinquisitor Torquemada zog die Inquisition von nun an folternd und mordend durch ganz Spanien, trieb die "Ketzer" aus dem Land oder zwang sie, zum Katholizismus zu konvertieren. [PARAGRAPH:2]Erstaunlicherweise behandelten Isabella und Ferdinand die Muslime nach der Eroberung Granadas (der letzten muslimischen Festung Spaniens) gut und erlaubten diesen sogar die freie Religionsaus&#252;bung. Die Juden Granadas wurden allerdings &#228;hnlich barbarisch behandelt wie im &#252;brigen Spanien. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabellas wohl ber&#252;hmteste Amtshandlung war die Finanzierung der Expedition von Christoph Kolumbus. Auf der Suche nach dem Seeweg nach Indien &#252;berquerte der italienische Navigator den Atlantik und entdeckte im Jahr 1492 Amerika. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabellas Bilanz als Herrscherin ist gespalten. Sie hat das Land geeint, die fremden M&#228;chte, die Spanien 700 Jahre lang besetzt hatten, vertrieben und den Frieden und die Stabilit&#228;t des Landes gesichert. Au&#223;erdem finanzierte sie Expeditionen, die ihr riesige L&#228;ndereien und unglaubliche Reicht&#252;mer einbringen sollten. Gleichzeitig war sie aber auch f&#252;r die schreckliche Folter- und Mordkampagne gegen die schw&#228;chste Bev&#246;lkerungsgruppe ihres Landes verantwortlich. F&#252;r ihre christlichen Untertanen war Isabella vermutlich das Beste, was ihnen passieren konnte. Isabella starb 1504 und &#252;berlie&#223; ihr K&#246;nigreich ihrer Tochter.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Isabella[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Regina di Spagna[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vissuta nel:[\BOLD] 1451 - 1504[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Storia:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Isabella era la figlia di re Giovanni II di Castiglia. All'epoca della sua nascita, la Spagna era divisa in diversi regni minori, tra i quali Castiglia, Portogallo e Aragona erano pi&#249; importanti. La parte meridionale del paese era sotto il dominio Arabo e i Mori avevano conquistato gran parte della Spagna, durante l'ottavo secolo. Per la Spagna Cristiana, c'erano due grandi obiettivi da perseguire: unire il paese e ricacciare i Mori. Isabella riusc&#236; a realizzarli entrambi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alla morte del padre, la Castiglia venne governata dal fratello maggiore di Isabella, re Enrico IV. A 18 anni, contro l'espresso desiderio di suo fratello, Isabella spos&#242; il principe Ferdinando, erede al trono di Aragona. Enrico era furioso, poich&#233; avrebbe voluto vederla spostata con il re del Portogallo, ma alla fine la perdon&#242; e la nomin&#242; sua erede. Alla sua morte, nel 1474, Isabella divenne la regina della Castiglia e, dopo una breve guerra, strinse un'alleanza con il Portogallo, unendo infine la Spagna.[PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella e Ferdinando lavorarono sorprendentemente bene insieme, governando equamente i due regni (sebbene, secondo molti storici, Isabella fosse al migliore tra i due).[PARAGRAPH:2]Una volta sul trono, la coppia si dedic&#242; a indebolire la nobilt&#224; spagnola, che Isabella riteneva avesse ottenuto troppo potere: crearono una forza militare speciale, nota come "Santa Fratellanza", che aveva il solo obiettivo di proteggere il popolo e le propriet&#224; dagli attacchi della nobilt&#224;. Inoltre, ridistribuirono parte delle terre dei nobili e distrussero alcuni dei loro castelli. Per quanto riguarda gli altri affari interni, Isabella e Ferdinando riorganizzarono i tribunali e il sistema di giustizia e riformarono la moneta nazionale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Altri programmi di governo erano meno attraenti: i due governatori erano dei fanatici cattolici e odiavano qualsiasi altra religione, in particolare quella degli Ebrei. Nel 1478, supplicarono il Papa affinch&#233; fondasse l'Inquisizione Spagnola. Sotto il comando del capo inquisitore Torquemada, l'Inquisizione tortur&#242; e uccise migliaia di Spagnoli, ricacciando gli "eretici" fuori dal paese o sotto terra, oppure costringendoli a convertisti al Cattolicesimo.[PARAGRAPH:2]&#200; interessante notare che, una volta conquistata Granada, l'ultima roccaforte musulmana in Spagna, Isabella e Ferdinando trattarono i Musulmani discretamente bene, permettendogli di praticare liberamente la loro religione in Spagna. Gli Ebrei di Granada, invece, furono trattati barbaramente, come i loro cugini del resto della Spagna.[PARAGRAPH:2]L'atto pi&#249; famoso di Isabella come monarca fu probabilmente il suo sostegno alla spedizione di Cristoforo Colombo, il navigatore italiano alla ricerca di una rotta a ovest che permettesse di raggiungere l'India. Una volta ottenuto il sostegno di Isabella, attravers&#242; l'Atlantico per trovare l'Asia e fin&#236; invece per scoprire l'America.[PARAGRAPH:2]Come governatrice, i risultati di Isabella furono altalenanti: riusc&#236; a unire il paese sotto il suo comando, ricacciando le potenze straniere che avevano occupato la Spagna per 700 anni, port&#242; pace e stabilit&#224; al paese e appoggi&#242; l'esplorazione, che avrebbe portato nuovi territori e ricchezze al regno, ma, d'altra parte, diede inizio a una terribile campagna di tortura e assassinio della popolazione pi&#249; inerme. Per la Cristianit&#224;, probabilmente, Isabella fu una delle migliori occasioni capitate, ma gli Ebrei hanno sicuramente un'opinione meno positiva di sua maest&#224;. Isabella mor&#236; nel 1504, lasciando il regno a sua figlia.</Italian>

Cuando naci&#243;, Espa&#241;a estaba dividida en varios reinos de menor tama&#241;o, entre los cuales destacaban Castilla, Portugal y Arag&#243;n. La parte meridional del pa&#237;s estaba en manos de los &#225;rabes (o "moros"), que hab&#237;an conquistado la mayor parte de la pen&#237;nsula en el siglo VIII. La Espa&#241;a cristiana ten&#237;a dos grandes objetivos: unir el pa&#237;s y expulsar a los moros. Isabel consigui&#243; ambas cosas. [PARAGRAPH:2]A la muerte de su padre, el reino qued&#243; en manos del hermano menor de Isabel, el rey Enrique IV. A los dieciocho a&#241;os, y contra el deseo expreso de su hermano, Isabel contrajo matrimonio con el pr&#237;ncipe Fernando, heredero al trono de Arag&#243;n. Enrique se enfureci&#243; con ella (su intenci&#243;n era casarla con el rey de Portugal), aunque al final acabar&#237;a por perdonarla y la nombrar&#237;a su heredera. A su muerte, en 1474, Isabel se convirti&#243; en Reina de Castilla, y, despu&#233;s de una corta guerra, concertar&#237;a una alianza con Portugal, unificando de este modo gran parte de Espa&#241;a. [PARAGRAPH:2]Isabel y Fernando trabajaron sorprendentemente bien juntos. Gobernaron conjuntamente sus dos reinos (seg&#250;n muchos historiadores, las cualidades como gobernante de Isabel eran mayores). [PARAGRAPH:2]Una vez entronizados, emprendieron un programa encaminado a debilitar a la nobleza de sus respectivos reinos, que, a juicio de Isabel, se hab&#237;a vuelto demasiado poderosa. Crearon una fuerza militar especial conocida como "Santa Hermandad", con el objetivo expreso de proteger al pueblo y la propiedad privada de los ataques de la nobleza. Tambi&#233;n redistribuyeron parte de las tierras de la nobleza y derruyeron algunos de sus castillos. En otros campos de la pol&#237;tica interior, Isabel y Fernando reorganizaron los tribunales y el sistema judicial, y regularon mejor el sistema de acu&#241;aci&#243;n monetaria. [PARAGRAPH:2]	Algunos de sus objetivos pol&#237;ticos no fueron tan encomiables. Ambos reyes eran cat&#243;licos fervientes, y sent&#237;an un odio feroz hacia las dem&#225;s religiones, especialmente el juda&#237;smo. En 1478 solicitaron al Papa que estableciera la Inquisici&#243;n espa&#241;ola. Bajo el Gran Inquisidor, Torquemada, la Inquisici&#243;n tortur&#243; y asesin&#243; a miles de personas en toda Espa&#241;a, expulsando u obligando a convertirse al catolicismo a todos los herejes del pa&#237;s. [PARAGRAPH:2]Curiosamente, tras la conquista de Granada, el &#250;ltimo enclave musulm&#225;n de Espa&#241;a, Isabel y Fernando trataron bastante bien a sus habitantes, a quienes concedieron el permiso de practicar libremente su religi&#243;n. Los jud&#237;os de Granada, en cambio, recibieron el mismo tratamiento b&#225;rbaro que en el resto del pa&#237;s. [PARAGRAPH:2]Es posible que el acto m&#225;s famoso de Isabel fuera financiar las expediciones de Col&#243;n. Crist&#243;bal Col&#243;n era un marino italiano que buscaba una ruta hacia la India por el oeste; con el respaldo de Isabel, parti&#243; rumbo a Asia cruzando el Atl&#225;ntico. Pero adonde realmente llegar&#237;a ser&#237;a a Am&#233;rica. [PARAGRAPH:2]El legado de Isabel como reina es dual. Con su ayuda, el pa&#237;s logr&#243; unificarse. Expuls&#243; a las potencias extranjeras que hab&#237;an gobernado Espa&#241;a durante m&#225;s de 700 a&#241;os. Trajo la paz y la estabilidad a su reino. Financi&#243; una empresa de exploraci&#243;n que proporcionar&#237;a inmensos territorios y vastas riquezas al reino. Pero, por otro lado, lanz&#243; una terrible campa&#241;a de tortura y asesinato contra las poblaciones m&#225;s vulnerables de su pa&#237;s. Para sus s&#250;bditos cristianos, probablemente fuera la mejor reina que nunca hubiese existido. Pero seguro que los jud&#237;os ten&#237;an una opini&#243;n menos favorable de Su Majestad.

Arguably the first nation to discover America, under Joao's reign Portugal made several other important discoveries while also advancing the field of nautical navigation.[PARAGRAPH:2]"I am the lord of lords, not the server of servants." These words, originally a castigation of rebellious nobles by Joao, would come to define the Portuguese king's reign. Joao's dislike of court intrigue and the inability for political opinion to influence his decisions made him an unpopular king amongst his peers. The King's early rule was defined by his efforts to curtail, and eventually crush, all internal corruption and opposition to his rule. After having intercepted conspiratorial letters between the Duke of Braganza and Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1483, Joao had the Duke executed, his family banished from Portugal, and his lands and wealth confiscated. [PARAGRAPH:2]Joao II's policies focused primarily on the exploration and exploitation of maritime trade routes, particularly with India. The full extent of Portugal's explorations and discoveries remain largely unknown due to the government's secrecy, born of a fierce competition with its neighbor Castile. It is, however, argued that Portugal had already reached North America and Brazil by 1470 and 1480, respectively. This places their discovery of North America in advance of Christopher Columbus's voyage.[PARAGRAPH:2]Portugal, under the reign of Joao, was also credited with the 1484 discovery of the Congo River, the 1488 rounding of the Cape of Good Hope (Africa's southern tip), and the 1493 settlement of the S&#227;o Tom&#233; and Pr&#237;ncipe Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Disputes over rights of exploration between Castile and Aragon and Portugal would eventually lead to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) which split the world in half. Portugal would be responsible for exploring the Eastern hemisphere while Aragon and Castile would have the Western hemisphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Towards the end of his reign, Joao's only legitimate heir, Alfonso, died under mysterious circumstances. This prevented Portugal from inheriting ownership of Castile and Aragon through Alfonso's marriage to Isabella of Aragon - Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon's eldest daughter. Joao II died without male heir in 1495, possibly poisoned by the vengeful Portuguese nobility and was succeeded by his first cousin, Manuel I.</English>

J.C.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Le roi Jean II de Portugal a soutenu l'exploration et l'exploitation du Nouveau monde. Premi&#232;re nation &#224; d&#233;couvrir l'Am&#233;rique, le Portugal, sous le r&#232;gne de Jean II, fait plusieurs autres d&#233;couvertes importantes tout en progressant dans le domaine de la navigation.[PARAGRAPH:2]"Je suis le seigneur des seigneurs, pas le servant des servants." Ces paroles, prononc&#233;es &#224; l'origine contre des nobles insurg&#233;s, vont finir par d&#233;finir le r&#232;gne du roi portugais. Le d&#233;dain de Jean pour les intrigues de la cour et l'incapacit&#233; de l'opinion politique &#224; influencer ses d&#233;cisions font de lui un roi impopulaire parmi ses pairs. Le d&#233;but de son r&#232;gne est marqu&#233; par ses efforts pour supprimer toute corruption et toute opposition &#224; la cour. Apr&#232;s avoir intercept&#233; des lettres conspiratrices entre le duc de Bragance et la reine Isabelle I&#232;re de Castille en 1483, Jean fait ex&#233;cuter le duc, bannit sa famille du Portugal et confisque ses terres et sa richesse.[PARAGRAPH:2]La politique de Jean II se concentre surtout sur l'exploration et l'exploitation des routes commerciales maritimes, en particulier avec l'Inde. L'ampleur r&#233;elle des explorations et d&#233;couvertes portugaises demeure largement inconnue en raison du secret gouvernemental, issu d'une f&#233;roce comp&#233;tition avec sa voisine, la Castille. On pense n&#233;anmoins que le Portugal a atteint l'Am&#233;rique du Nord en 1470 et le Br&#233;sil en 1480, ce qui place leur d&#233;couverte de l'Am&#233;rique du Nord avant le voyage de Christophe Colomb.[PARAGRAPH:2]On attribue &#233;galement au Portugal la d&#233;couverte du fleuve Congo en 1484, le contournement du Cap de Bonne-Esp&#233;rance (la pointe sud de l'Afrique) en 1448 et la colonisation des &#238;les de S&#227;o Tom&#233; et de Pr&#237;ncipe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Des querelles portant sur les droits d'exploration entre la Castille et l'Aragon finissent par donner naissance au trait&#233; de Tordesillas (1494) qui va diviser le monde en deux. Le Portugal sera responsable de l'exploration de l'h&#233;misph&#232;re oriental, tandis que l'Aragon et la Castille se partageront l'h&#233;misph&#232;re occidental.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vers la fin de son r&#232;gne, Alfonso, seul fils l&#233;gitime de Jean, mourut dans d'&#233;tranges circonstances. Ceci emp&#234;cha le Portugal d'h&#233;riter de la propri&#233;t&#233; de la Castille et de l'Aragon apr&#232;s le mariage d'Alfonso avec Isabelle d'Aragon (fille a&#238;n&#233;e d'Isabelle I&#232;re de Castille et de Ferdinand II d'Aragon). Jean II meurt en 1495, probablement empoisonn&#233; par la noblesse portugaise. Il n'avait aucun h&#233;ritier masculin et ce fut son premier cousin, Manuel Ier, qui lui succ&#233;da.</French>

Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]K&#246;nig Joao II. von Portugal war ein Staatsmann, der die Erforschung und Ausbeutung unbekannter Gebiete unterst&#252;tzte. Abgesehen davon, dass m&#246;glicherweise Portugal Amerika entdeckte, machte diese Nation unter Joaos Herrschaft zahlreiche wichtige Entdeckungen und baute ihre F&#228;higkeiten im Bereich der Schifffahrt aus.[PARAGRAPH:2]"Ich bin der Herrscher der Herrschenden, nicht der Diener der Dienenden." Diese Worte, die urspr&#252;nglich aus der Unterwerfung rebellischer Adeliger durch Joao stammen, kennzeichneten die Herrschaft des portugiesischen K&#246;nigs. Joaos Abneigung gegen Intrigen zu Hofe und die Tatsache, dass er seine Entscheidungen unabh&#228;ngig von der politischen Meinung traf, machten ihn unter Seinesgleichen zu einem wenig beliebten K&#246;nig. Seine fr&#252;he Herrschaft war von seinen Bem&#252;hungen gekennzeichnet, jegliche interne Korruption und Opposition seiner Herrschaft zu unterbinden. Nachdem er 1493 Verschw&#246;rerbriefe zwischen dem Herzog von Bragan&#231;a und der K&#246;nigin Isabella I. von Kastilien abgefangen hatte, lie&#223; Joao den Herzog hinrichten, verbannte dessen Familie aus Portugal und konfiszierte seine Reicht&#252;mer und L&#228;ndereien.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Politik von Joao II. konzentrierte sich vor allem auf die Erforschung und Ausbeutung maritimer Handelswege, im Speziellen mit Indien. Das volle Ausma&#223; von Portugals Entdeckungen und Erforschungen ist aufgrund der Geheimhaltung der Regierung, die sich aus dem erbitterten Wettbewerb mit seinem Nachbarn Kastilien ergab, nicht bekannt. Behauptungen zufolge soll Portugal Nordamerika bereits 1470 und Brasilien bereits 1480 erreicht haben. Demzufolge h&#228;tte Portugal Nordamerika bereits vor Christoph Kolumbus entdeckt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zugeschrieben wurde Portugal unter der Herrschaft von Joao auch die Entdeckung des Flusses Kongo im Jahre 1484, die Umfahrung des Kaps der Guten Hoffnung (der S&#252;dspitze Afrikas) im Jahre 1488 und die Besiedlung der Inseln S&#227;o Tom&#233; und Pr&#237;ncipe im Jahre 1493.[PARAGRAPH:2]Streitigkeiten, die zwischen Kastilien, Aragon und Portugal &#252;ber die Rechte an den entdeckten Gebieten entbrannten, f&#252;hrten schlie&#223;lich zum Vertrag von Tordesillas (1494), der die Welt in zwei H&#228;lften teilte. Portugal war verantwortlich f&#252;r die Entdeckung der &#246;stlichen Hemisph&#228;re, Aragon und Kastilien f&#252;r die der westlichen Hemisph&#228;re.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gegen Ende seiner Herrschaft starb Joaos einziger legitimer Thronfolger Alfonso unter mysteri&#246;sen Umst&#228;nden. Dadurch konnte Portugal Kastilien und Aragon nicht in Besitz nehmen, was durch Alfonsos Heirat mit Isabella von Aragon, der &#228;ltesten Tochter von Isabella I. von Kastilien und Ferdinand II. von Aragon, in die Wege geleitet worden war. Joao II. starb ohne m&#228;nnlichen Nachfolger im Jahre 1495. M&#246;glicherweise wurde er von einem portugiesischen Adeligen vergiftet. Sein Nachfolger war sein Cousin ersten Grades, Manuel I.</German>

Presumibilmente la prima nazione a scoprire l'America, sotto il regno di Giovanni il Portogallo fece diverse altre importanti scoperte e allo stesso tempo progred&#236; nel campo della navigazione nautica.[PARAGRAPH:2]"Io sono il signore dei signori, non il servitore dei servi". Queste parole, in origine una condanna di nobili ribelli da parte di Giovanni, definirono successivamente il regno del re portoghese. Il disprezzo di Giovanni per gli intrighi di corte e la sua inabilit&#224; nelle questioni politiche lo resero un re impopolare tra i suoi pari. La prima parte del suo dominio fu caratterizzata dai suoi tentativi di ridurre, ed eventualmente schiacciare, la corruzione interna e l'opposizione al suo governo. Dopo aver intercettato lettere cospiratorie tra il duca di Braganza e la regina Isabella I di Castiglia, nel 1483, Giovanni fece giustiziare il duca, band&#236; la sua famiglia dal Portogallo e confisc&#242; i suoi beni e le sue terre. [PARAGRAPH:2]La politica di Giovanni II era principalmente focalizzata sull'esplorazione e lo sfruttamento di rotte commerciali marittime, in particolare con l'India. Le reali dimensioni delle esplorazioni e delle scoperte del Portogallo rimangono sconosciute, a causa della segretezza del governo, nata da una feroce competizione con la vicina Castiglia. Si discute comunque sul fatto che il Portogallo avesse gi&#224; raggiunto il Nord America e il Brasile rispettivamente nel 1470 e nel 1480. Ci&#242; anticiperebbe la scoperta del Nord America rispetto a quella di Cristoforo Colombo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Al Portogallo, sotto il regno di Giovanni, venne anche attribuita la scoperta del fiume Congo nel 1484, la circumnavigazione del Capo di Buona Speranza (la punta meridionale dell'Africa) nel 1488 e la colonizzazione, nel 1493, delle isole S&#227;o Tom&#233; e Pr&#237;ncipe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Le dispute sui diritti d'esplorazione tra Castiglia, Aragona e Portogallo portarono al Trattato di Tordesillas (1494), che divise a met&#224; il mondo. Il Portogallo sarebbe stato responsabile dell'esplorazione dell'emisfero orientale, mentre Aragona e Castiglia avrebbero pensato a quello occidentale.[PARAGRAPH:2]Verso la fine del suo regno, l'unico erede legittimo di Giovanni, Alfonso, mor&#236; in circostanze misteriose. Ci&#242; imped&#236; al Portogallo di ereditare il dominio su Castiglia e Aragona attraverso il matrimonio di Alfonso con Isabella di Aragona, la figlia maggiore di Isabella I di Castiglia e Ferdinando II di Aragona. Giovanni II mor&#236; senza eredi maschi nel 1495, forse avvelenato dalla vendicativa nobilt&#224; portoghese, e gli successe il suo primo cugino, Manuele I.</Italian>

Estas palabras, pronunciadas por Juan al anunciar la condena de un grupo de nobles rebeldes, acabar&#237;an por convertirse en el lema de su reinado. El desagrado que le inspiraban las intrigas de la corte y su resistencia a dejarse influir por las opiniones pol&#237;ticas lo convirtieron en un rey impopular. Los primeros a&#241;os de su reinado estuvieron presididos por sus esfuerzos por reducir, y luego aplastar, la corrupci&#243;n interna y la oposici&#243;n a su gobierno. Tras caer en sus manos unas cartas acusadoras en las que el duque de Braganza y la reina Isabel I de Castilla tramaban una conspiraci&#243;n en su contra (1483), Juan mand&#243; al duque al cadalso, exili&#243; a su familia y confisc&#243; todas sus tierras y riquezas. [PARAGRAPH:2]Su pol&#237;tica estuvo enfocada principalmente a la exploraci&#243;n y explotaci&#243;n de rutas comerciales mar&#237;timas, especialmente a la India. El alcance real de las exploraciones y descubrimientos de Portugal era un misterio, debido en gran parte al secretismo del gobierno derivado de la feroz competencia con la vecina Castilla. De hecho, existe la teor&#237;a de que Portugal descubri&#243; Norteam&#233;rica y Brasil en 1470 y 1480, respectivamente. Si esto fuera cierto, el descubrimiento de Am&#233;rica se habr&#237;a producido antes del primer viaje de Crist&#243;bal Col&#243;n.[PARAGRAPH:2]Adem&#225;s, durante su reinado, Portugal descubri&#243; el r&#237;o Congo (1484), circunval&#243; &#193;frica por el cabo de Buena Esperanza (1488) y coloniz&#243; las islas de S&#227;o Tom&#233; y Pr&#237;ncipe (1493).[PARAGRAPH:2]Las disputas con Castilla y Arag&#243;n por los derechos de exploraci&#243;n acabar&#237;an desembocando en el tratado de Tordesillas (1494), que dividi&#243; el mundo en dos mitades. Portugal se reservar&#237;a la exploraci&#243;n del hemisferio oriental, mientras que el occidental quedar&#237;a en manos de Arag&#243;n y Castilla.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hacia el final de su reinado, el &#250;nico heredero leg&#237;timo de Juan, Alfonso, muri&#243; en extra&#241;as circunstancias.

In 1544, the young Count of Nassau, but 11 years old, became the Prince of Orange through an inheritance, with new holdings in the Netherlands waiting for young Willem to come of age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje was raised in the lap of luxury, his family a favorite of the Spanish monarch in control of the Netherlands, Charles V. Oranje received his education in France at the behest of the Spanish King and proved to be both a precocious student and a charismatic leader. With the completion of his education, Oranje took control of his estates in the Netherlands. Thanks in part to his calm demeanor, which was a welcome change during an age of rising tensions, Oranje was appointed to a number of important posts within the Dutch government, eventually reaching the position of stadtholder, the highest rank open to a Dutchman. His selection to this auspicious rank came thanks to Phillip II, Charles' son and the new King.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 1559, enforcement of the law of Placaten, which made Protestantism not only a religious crime, but a civil one as well, increased bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics throughout the Netherlands. Oranje, taking a stance against the persecution of Protestants in the Netherlands, gradually found himself on the wrong side of the Catholic Spanish monarchs. Catching word of an imminent assassination attempt, Oranje was forced to retreat to his castle in Nassau, hoping to keep himself alive and free of the growing Dutch rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Phillip II sent Fernando de Toledo, the Duke of Alva, to deal with the uprising and arrest its leaders, Oranje was included in the list of outlaws. After failing to defeat Alva with his meager army, Oranje again fled, fortifying himself in the states of Holland. The Prince of Oranje, universally recognized for his ability and cunning, now found himself embroiled in the heart of the sweeping Dutch rebellion, which would continue to grow in size and scope into what became known as the Eighty Years' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to sudden changes in Spanish leadership within the region, a number of provinces, taking advantage of the ensuing havoc, allied themselves with Oranje and the rebellion. With the signing of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, the five northern provinces of the Netherlands, along with much of Flanders and Brabant, previously separate, united in their opposition to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]To support the insufficient Dutch forces, Oranje had sought foreign aid and in 1581 received word from Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of the French king, that if the struggling provinces declared independence from Spain and appointed Francis their sovereign, he would aid them in defeating their Spanish foe. So, on July 26, 1581, the United Provinces declared their independence from Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje, unfortunately, was unable to enjoy his country's new independence for long. Unhappy with the restrictions the Dutch nobles had placed on his powers, the Duke of Anjou turned against Oranje and his peers. And while Anjou was defeated not long after, an assassin hired by King Phillip gunned down Willem van Oranje in 1584, bringing to an end the leader's grand struggle for Dutch freedom.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Oranje had passed on, the want for an independent Netherlands did not. Struggles would continue with the Spanish, but in 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia would end the Eighty Years' War and finally grant the country the self-determination that Willem van Oranje had died trying to institute.</English>

Sa famille &#233;tant dans les bonnes gr&#226;ces du monarque espagnol des Pays-Bas, Charles Quint, il re&#231;oit son &#233;ducation en France &#224; la cour du roi espagnol et se r&#233;v&#232;le &#224; la fois un &#233;l&#232;ve pr&#233;coce et un dirigeant charismatique.

Gr&#226;ce en partie &#224; son flegme, tr&#232;s appr&#233;ci&#233; en cette p&#233;riode de tensions croissantes, Guillaume est nomm&#233; &#224; plusieurs postes importants au sein du gouvernement n&#233;erlandais pour finalement atteindre le statut de Stathouder, la plus haute responsabilit&#233; aux Pays-Bas. Sa nomination &#224; ce poste est largement appuy&#233;e par Philippe II, fils de Charles et nouveau roi.[PARAGRAPH:2]En 1559, l'application de la loi de Placaten, qui fait du protestantisme un crime religieux et civil, contribue au bain de sang lors duquel s'opposent protestants et catholiques &#224; travers tous les Pays-Bas. Guillaume, s'engageant contre la pers&#233;cution des protestants aux Pays-bas, s'attire progressivement les foudres des rois catholiques espagnols. Ayant appris l'imminence d'une tentative d'assassinat &#224; son encontre, Guillaume est contraint de se retirer dans son ch&#226;teau de Nassau, esp&#233;rant sauver sa vie et rester &#224; l'&#233;cart de la r&#233;volte n&#233;erlandaise qui couve &#224; cette &#233;poque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Quand Philippe II envoie Ferdinand Alvare de Tol&#232;de, duc d'Albe, s'occuper de la r&#233;bellion et arr&#234;ter ses meneurs, Guillaume est inclus dans la liste des hors-la-loi. Sa maigre arm&#233;e est vaincue par le duc d'Albe et Guillaume s'enfuit donc &#224; nouveau, se r&#233;fugiant en Hollande. Le prince d'Orange, reconnu par tous pour son habilet&#233; et sa ruse, se retrouve alors entra&#238;n&#233; au coeur de la r&#233;volte n&#233;erlandaise, laquelle allait continuer &#224; prendre de l'ampleur et &#234;tre connue sous le nom de Guerre de quatre-vingts ans.[PARAGRAPH:2]En raison des nombreux changements chez les dirigeants espagnols de la r&#233;gion, de nombreuses provinces, profitant du chaos, s'allient avec Guillaume et la r&#233;bellion. Avec la signature de l'Union d'Utrecht en 1579, les cinq provinces septentrionales des Pays-Bas et une grande partie des Flandres et du Brabant, jusque-l&#224; s&#233;par&#233;es, s'unissent contre l'Espagne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pour soutenir les faibles troupes n&#233;erlandaises, Guillaume cherche de l'aide et en 1581, Fran&#231;ois, duc d'Anjou et fr&#232;re du roi, lui fait savoir qu'il les aiderait &#224; combattre l'ennemi espagnol pour peu que les provinces proclament leur ind&#233;pendance et le nomment roi. Et c'est ainsi que le 26 juillet 1581, les Provinces unies font s&#233;cession.[PARAGRAPH:2]Guillaume, malheureusement, ne peut pas jouir longtemps de la nouvelle ind&#233;pendance de son pays.

Mit dem Abschluss seiner Studien &#252;bernahm Wilhelm von Oranien die Herrschaft &#252;ber seine L&#228;ndereien in den Niederlanden. Dank seiner ruhigen Art, die in Zeiten wachsender Spannungen sehr willkommen war, wurde Wilhelm von Oranien mehrfach mit wichtigen &#196;mtern innerhalb der holl&#228;ndischen Regierung betraut und erreichte schlie&#223;lich die Position des Statthalters, den h&#246;chsten Rang, den ein Holl&#228;nder erreichen konnte. Seine Wahl auf diesen gesegneten Posten geschah durch die Gunst Phillips II., des neuen K&#246;nigs und Sohns Karls V.[PARAGRAPH:2]1559 hatte die Durchsetzung des Edikts, das den Protestantismus nicht nur zu einem religi&#246;sen, sondern auch zu einem zivilrechtlichen Verbrechen machte, das Blutvergie&#223;en zwischen Protestanten und Katholiken &#252;berall in den Niederlanden verst&#228;rkt. Wilhelm, der sich gegen die Verfolgung von Protestanten in den Niederlanden aussprach, fand sich allm&#228;hlich in der Ungunst der katholischen K&#246;nige Spaniens wieder. Als ihn die Nachricht von einem bevorstehenden Attentat erreichte, war Wilhelm gezwungen, sich auf seine Burg in Nassau zur&#252;ckzuziehen, um sein Leben zu retten und sich dem wachsenden Aufstand in den Niederlanden fernzuhalten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Phillip II. Fernando de Toledo, den Herzog von Alba, schickte, um den Aufstand niederzuschlagen und die R&#228;delsf&#252;hrer zu verhaften, war auch der Name Wilhelm von Oranien unter den Ge&#228;chteten. Nachdem es ihm mit seiner k&#252;mmerlichen Armee nicht gelungen war, Alba zu schlagen, floh Wilhelm erneut und verschanzte sich in den Staaten von Holland. Der Prinz von Oranien, der aufgrund seiner F&#228;higkeiten und seines Scharfsinns &#252;berall gesch&#228;tzt wurde, fand sich nun mitten im Zentrum des niederl&#228;ndischen Aufstands wieder, der an Gr&#246;&#223;e und Tragweite zum Achtzigj&#228;hrigen Krieg auswachsen sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aufgrund pl&#246;tzlicher &#196;nderungen innerhalb der spanischen F&#252;hrung in der Region ergriff eine Anzahl von Provinzen die Gelegenheit, die sich w&#228;hrend des so entstandenen Chaos bot, und verb&#252;ndete sich mit Wilhelm von Oranien und der Rebellion. Mit der Unterzeichnung der Utrechter Union 1579 taten sich die f&#252;nf n&#246;rdlichen Provinzen der Niederlande und Gro&#223;teile des bisher unabh&#228;ngigen Flanderns und Brabants im vereinten Widerstand gegen Spanien zusammen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Um die ungen&#252;genden holl&#228;ndischen Truppen zu unterst&#252;tzen, ersuchte Wilhelm von Oranien um fremde Hilfe und erhielt 1581 die Zusage von Franz, dem Herzog von Anjou und Bruder des franz&#246;sischen K&#246;nigs, dass er sie beim Kampf gegen den spanischen Feind unterst&#252;tzen w&#252;rde, wenn sich die k&#228;mpfenden Provinzen von Spanien unabh&#228;ngig und Franz zu ihrem Oberhaupt erkl&#228;rten. Also erkl&#228;rten die Vereinigten Provinzen am 26. Juli 1581 ihre Unabh&#228;ngigkeit von Spanien.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wilhelm von Oranien konnte sich ungl&#252;cklicherweise nicht lange an der neuen Unabh&#228;ngigkeit seines Landes erfreuen. Unzufrieden mit den Einschr&#228;nkungen, die der holl&#228;ndische Adel seiner Macht auferlegt hatte, wandte sich der Herzog von Anjou gegen Wilhelm von Oranien und seine Standesgenossen. Anjou wurde kurze Zeit sp&#228;ter besiegt, jedoch schoss ein von K&#246;nig Phillip angeheuerter Meuchelm&#246;rder Wilhelm von Oranien 1584 nieder und beendete so den gro&#223;en Kampf dieses Staatsoberhaupts f&#252;r die Freiheit Hollands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wilhelm von Oranien war zwar dahingeschieden, doch nicht so das Verlangen nach der Unabh&#228;ngigkeit der Niederlande. Die K&#228;mpfe gegen die Spanier gingen weiter, doch 1648 beendete der Westf&#228;lische Friede den Achtzigj&#228;hrigen Krieg und verlieh dem Land endlich die Selbstbestimmung, f&#252;r die Wilhelm von Oranien gestorben war.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Guglielmo d'Orange[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Principe d'Orange, Stadtholder d'Olanda[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vita:[\BOLD] 24 aprile 1533 - 10 luglio 1584 d.C.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Informazioni:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Guglielmo d'Orange, conosciuto anche come "Guglielmo il Taciturno", nacque nel 1533 nel casato di Nassau, una nobile e prominente famiglia in quella che &#232; l'attuale Germania. Nel 1544 il giovane conte di Nassau, di soli 11 anni, eredit&#242; il titolo di principe d'Orange, con tanto di nuovi possedimenti in Olanda che avrebbe avuto alla maggiore et&#224;.[PARAGRAPH:2]D'Orange crebbe nel lusso e la sua famiglia era una delle favorite del monarca spagnolo che controllava i Paesi Bassi, Carlo V. Guglielmo fu educato in Francia per ordine del Re di Spagna e prov&#242; di essere sia uno studente precoce sia un leader carismatico. Al completamento della sua educazione, Guglielmo prese il controllo dei suoi possedimenti in Olanda. Il suo comportamento calmo fu un lieto cambiamento in un'era di tensioni in aumento e, grazie a questo, ottenne un discreto numero di incarichi nel governo olandese, raggiungendo infine il titolo di stadtholder, la pi&#249; alta carica disponibile per un olandese. Fu scelto per tale posizione grazie a Filippo II, figlio di Carlo e nuovo Re.[PARAGRAPH:2]Intorno al 1559, l'applicazione di rigorose leggi religiose, che resero il protestantesimo un crimine non solo religioso ma anche civile, aumentarono gli scontri tra cattolici e protestanti in tutti i Paesi Bassi. D'Orange prese posizione contro la persecuzione dei protestanti e, a poco a poco, si ritrov&#242; in posizione opposta a quella dei monarchi spagnoli cattolici. Avvertito di un imminente tentativo d'assassinio, Guglielmo fu costretto a ritirarsi nel proprio castello a Nassau, sperando di rimanere vivo e al di fuori della ribellione olandese.[PARAGRAPH:2]Quando Filippo II invi&#242; Fernando di Toledo, il Duca d'Alba, a gestire la protesta e ad arrestarne i capi, Guglielmo fu incluso nella lista dei fuorilegge. Non riuscendo a sconfiggere il Duca d'Alba con il proprio misero esercito, d'Orange fugg&#236; nuovamente, fortificando la propria posizione in Olanda. Il principe d'Orange, universalmente conosciuto per la sua abilit&#224; e la sua astuzia, si trov&#242; di colpo coinvolto nel cuore della ribellione olandese, che avrebbe continuato a crescere fino a trasformarsi in quella che verr&#224; conosciuta come Guerra degli 80 anni.[PARAGRAPH:2]A causa degli improvvisi cambiamenti nella guida spagnola della regione, alcune province approfittarono della confusione e si allearono con Guglielmo e i ribelli. Con la firma dell'Unione di Utrecht, nel 1579, le cinque province settentrionali dei Paesi Bassi, assieme a gran parte delle Fiandre e del Brabante, prima separate, si unirono nella lotta alla Spagna.[PARAGRAPH:2]Guglielmo aveva cercato supporto per le scarse forze olandesi e, nel 1581, ricevette un messaggio da Francesco, Duca d'Angi&#242; e fratello del Re di Francia, che se le province avessero dichiarato la propria indipendenza dalla Spagna e lo stesso Francesco come proprio signore, egli le avrebbe aiutate a sconfiggere il nemico spagnolo. Cos&#236; il 26 luglio 1581 le Province Unite dichiararono la propria indipendenza dalla Spagna.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sfortunatamente Guglielmo d'Orange non riusc&#236; a godersi a lungo la neonata indipendenza del proprio Paese. Insoddisfatto delle restrizioni poste dagli olandesi ai suoi poteri, il Duca d'Angi&#242; si rivolt&#242; contro d'Orange e i suoi seguaci. Pur essendo il Duca d'Angi&#242; sconfitto poco dopo, un assassino assoldato da Re Filippo riusc&#236; a uccidere Guglielmo d'Orange nel 1584, ponendo fine alla sua lotta per la libert&#224; degli olandesi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nonostante la morte di Guglielmo d'Orange, il desiderio d'indipendenza dei Paesi Bassi non si spense. Gli scontri con gli spagnoli continuarono, ma nel 1648 il Trattato di Westfalia mise fine alla Guerra degli 80 anni e garant&#236; finalmente al Paese l'autodeterminazione per il cui raggiungimento era morto Guglielmo d'Orange.</Italian>

Al completar sus estudios, Orange tom&#243; el control de sus posesiones holandesas. Gracias en parte a su comportamiento tranquilo, grata excepci&#243;n en una era de tensiones, Orange fue nombrado para una serie de importantes puestos en el seno del gobierno holand&#233;s, hasta alcanzar la posici&#243;n de estat&#250;der, el cargo m&#225;s elevado accesible a un holand&#233;s. Su elecci&#243;n se debi&#243; a Felipe II, hijo de Carlos y nuevo rey.[PARAGRAPH:2]En 1559, tras la promulgaci&#243;n de la ley Placaten, que declaraba al protestantismo un delito civil adem&#225;s de religioso, la violencia entre cat&#243;licos y protestantes en Holanda se increment&#243; considerablemente. Orange, por su postura contraria a las purgas antiprotestantes, fue ocupando gradualmente una posici&#243;n contraria a los reyes cat&#243;licos espa&#241;oles. Al enterarse de que se fraguaba un intento de asesinato contra su persona, Orange se vio obligado a refugiarse en su castillo de Nassau, y decidi&#243; mantenerse apartado de los rebeldes para no comprometer su posici&#243;n.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sin embargo, a la llegada de Fernando de Toledo, duque de Alba, enviado por Felipe II para aplacar la revuelta y detener a los sediciosos, Orange se vio incluido en la lista de los proscritos. Derrotado su modesto ej&#233;rcito por el duque de Alba, Orange volvi&#243; a huir y se atrincher&#243; en sus posesiones holandesas. El pr&#237;ncipe de Orange, reconocido universalmente por su habilidad y astucia, se encontraba ahora metido de lleno en la revuelta holandesa, que continuar&#237;a creciendo y creciendo hasta convertirse en lo que hoy en d&#237;a se conoce como Guerra de los Ochenta A&#241;os.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aprovechando los cambios bruscos en las autoridades espa&#241;olas de la regi&#243;n, varias provincias se aliaron con Orange y la rebeli&#243;n. Con la firma de la Uni&#243;n de Utrecht en 1579, las cinco provincias septentrionales de Holanda, junto con gran parte de Flandes y Brabante, separados hasta entonces, se unieron para oponerse a Espa&#241;a.[PARAGRAPH:2]Para apoyar a las escasas tropas holandesas, Orange busc&#243; ayuda en el extranjero y, en 1581 recibi&#243; la promesa de Francisco, duque de Anjou y hermano del rey de Francia, de que, si las provincias rebeldes se declaraban independientes de Espa&#241;a y le nombraban soberano, &#233;l las ayudar&#237;a a vencer a sus enemigos espa&#241;oles. As&#237; que el 26 de julio de 1581, las Provincias Unidas declararon su independencia de Espa&#241;a.[PARAGRAPH:2]Por desgracia, Orange, no pudo disfrutar mucho tiempo de la independencia de su pa&#237;s. Descontento con las restricciones que los nobles holandeses hab&#237;an impuesto a sus poderes, el duque de Anjou se volvi&#243; contra Orange y sus partidarios. Y mientras Anjou era vencido poco despu&#233;s, un asesino contratado por el rey Felipe acab&#243; con la vida de Guillermo de Orange en 1584, lo que supuso el fin de la lucha por la libertad de este gran l&#237;der.[PARAGRAPH:2]No obstante, aunque Orange hubiese perecido, el af&#225;n de independencia de los holandeses no lo hab&#237;a hecho.

In 1544, the young Count of Nassau, but 11 years old, became the Prince of Orange through an inheritance, with new holdings in the Netherlands waiting for young Willem to come of age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje was raised in the lap of luxury, his family a favorite of the Spanish monarch in control of the Netherlands, Charles V. Oranje received his education in France at the behest of the Spanish King and proved to be both a precocious student and a charismatic leader. With the completion of his education, Oranje took control of his estates in the Netherlands. Thanks in part to his calm demeanor, which was a welcome change during an age of rising tensions, Oranje was appointed to a number of important posts within the Dutch government, eventually reaching the position of stadtholder, the highest rank open to a Dutchman. His selection to this auspicious rank came thanks to Phillip II, Charles' son and the new King.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 1559, enforcement of the law of Placaten, which made Protestantism not only a religious crime, but a civil one as well, increased bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics throughout the Netherlands. Oranje, taking a stance against the persecution of Protestants in the Netherlands, gradually found himself on the wrong side of the Catholic Spanish monarchs. Catching word of an imminent assassination attempt, Oranje was forced to retreat to his castle in Nassau, hoping to keep himself alive and free of the growing Dutch rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Phillip II sent Fernando de Toledo, the Duke of Alva, to deal with the uprising and arrest its leaders, Oranje was included in the list of outlaws. After failing to defeat Alva with his meager army, Oranje again fled, fortifying himself in the states of Holland. The Prince of Oranje, universally recognized for his ability and cunning, now found himself embroiled in the heart of the sweeping Dutch rebellion, which would continue to grow in size and scope into what became known as the Eighty Years' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to sudden changes in Spanish leadership within the region, a number of provinces, taking advantage of the ensuing havoc, allied themselves with Oranje and the rebellion. With the signing of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, the five northern provinces of the Netherlands, along with much of Flanders and Brabant, previously separate, united in their opposition to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]To support the insufficient Dutch forces, Oranje had sought foreign aid and in 1581 received word from Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of the French king, that if the struggling provinces declared independence from Spain and appointed Francis their sovereign, he would aid them in defeating their Spanish foe. So, on July 26, 1581, the United Provinces declared their independence from Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje, unfortunately, was unable to enjoy his country's new independence for long. Unhappy with the restrictions the Dutch nobles had placed on his powers, the Duke of Anjou turned against Oranje and his peers. And while Anjou was defeated not long after, an assassin hired by King Phillip gunned down Willem van Oranje in 1584, bringing to an end the leader's grand struggle for Dutch freedom.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Oranje had passed on, the want for an independent Netherlands did not. Struggles would continue with the Spanish, but in 1648, the Treaty of Westphalia would end the Eighty Years' War and finally grant the country the self-determination that Willem van Oranje had died trying to institute.</Portuguese>

		<English>[H1]Mehmed II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of the Ottoman Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] March 30, 1432 - May 3, 1481 CE[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mehmed II, also known as el-Fatih ("the Conqueror") was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1451 - 1481 AD. He is best known for capturing the city of Constantinople, turning it into the new Ottoman capital and destroying the Byzantine Empire in the process. Mehmed was born in Edirne, which was then the capital of the Ottoman state, in 1432. He was fascinated by military matters from an early age; by the time that he reached maturity and ascended to the position of sultan (in 1451), Mehmed was prepared to begin the attack upon the city of Constantinople. [PARAGRAPH:2]During the thousand-year history of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople had withstood sieges many times. It had only been captured once, by the Fourth Crusaders in 1204. But by the fifteenth century the Byzantine Empire was a battered shell of its former self: while it still held Constantinople, it retained only a few small territories outside the city's walls (mainly in Greece). [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed began the siege by constructing a pair of fortresses on both sides of the straights surrounding the city, thus preventing reinforcement by sea. When Mehmed attacked in 1453, the Byzantines were horribly outnumbered: there were only 7000 defenders to meet an army of roughly 100,000 Turks. Help was not forthcoming from the West, which remained hostile to the Byzantines because of the split between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. [PARAGRAPH:2]Using enormous primitive cannon, the Ottomans battered the walls of Constantinople for weeks (although the rate of fire was so slow that the defenders were able to repair much of the damage as it took place). On May 29 Mehmed finally ordered an assault at a damaged section of the walls. The assault was successful, and the attackers succeeded in breaking into the city streets. The city's fate was sealed. The last Emperor, Constantine XI, died in battle, and the ancient empire was extinguished forever. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed gave his soldiers a day to loot the city (which was a customary practice at the time), during which a large portion of the populace was slaughtered, raped, or enslaved. After his soldiers' greed and lust were sated, Mehmed made every effort to rebuild the city and repopulate it with Turks. (Despite this odious "ethnic cleansing" at the beginning of his reign, Mehmed generally treated his non-Islamic subjects well, granting them permission to practice their religion freely, as well as a great deal of local autonomy.) The Byzantine administration was largely preserved intact and was given the task of running the Ottoman Empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon consolidating his control over Constantinople, Mehmed finished off the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire by conquering some small states in Greece and in 1461 he conquered the tiny Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea. He then tried to extend his empire into Europe, but in 1462 he was defeated by Prince Vlad III (the real Count Dracula) of Wallachia, and at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475 he suffered a major loss to the Moldavian Prince Stefan. These defeats put an end to that campaign. However, Mehmed still had ambition - and plenty of it. [PARAGRAPH:2]Believing that his conquest of Rome made him the legitimate ruler of the late Roman Empire, at the end of his life Mehmed embarked on an ambitious but foolhardy campaign to reunite his divided empire. The campaign began well; the Ottomans invaded Italy, and in 1840 the city of Otranto was easily captured. However, a rebellion in Albania the same year threatened the Ottoman supply lines, forcing the Ottomans to divide their forces. The following year a large Christian army led by the pope pushed the Ottomans from Italy. Mehmed died in 1481, putting an end forever to his dream of recapturing the ancient glory of Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]In large, history has judged Mehmed kindly. He is recognized for his military success and his strong rule, and later Ottoman sultans would seek to follow his example. Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was one of the most important events in Western history, signifying the end of the medieval period. His attack upon Italy may have been foolish, but it ultimately did little to harm the young Ottoman Empire that was his legacy.</English>
		<French>[H1]Mehmet II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan de l'Empire ottoman[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dates:[\BOLD] 1432 - 1481[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mehmet II, dit el-Fatih ("le Conqu&#233;rant") est le sultan de l'Empire ottoman entre 1451 et 1481 ap. J.-C. Il est surtout connu pour sa prise de la ville de Constantinople, la transformant en nouvelle capitale de l'Empire ottoman et d&#233;truisant parall&#232;lement l'Empire byzantin. Mehmet est n&#233; en 1432 &#224; Edirne, qui est alors la capitale de l'Etat ottoman. D&#232;s son plus jeune &#226;ge, il est fascin&#233; par les questions militaires et lorsqu'il atteint l'&#226;ge adulte et acc&#232;de &#224; la fonction de sultan, en 1451, Mehmet est pr&#234;t &#224; attaquer la ville de Constantinople. [PARAGRAPH:2]Au cours de l'histoire mill&#233;naire de l'Empire byzantin, Constantinople a r&#233;sist&#233; &#224; de nombreux si&#232;ges et n'a &#233;t&#233; prise qu'en 1204, lors de la quatri&#232;me croisade. Cependant, au XVe si&#232;cle, l'Empire byzantin n'est plus que l'ombre de lui-m&#234;me : s'il poss&#232;de encore Constantinople, il ne comporte plus que quelques petits territoires hors des murs de la ville, essentiellement en Gr&#232;ce. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet assi&#232;ge Constantinople en construisant deux forteresses sur les deux rives des d&#233;troits qui encerclent la ville, pour &#233;viter tout renfort par la mer. Lorsque Mehmet attaque en 1453, les Byzantins sont bien moins nombreux : on compte environ 7000 d&#233;fenseurs de la ville contre une arm&#233;e d'environ 100 000 Turcs. L'Occident n'est pas pr&#234;t &#224; apporter son aide car il reste hostile aux Byzantins en raison de la division entre les Eglises catholique et orthodoxe. [PARAGRAPH:2]A l'aide d'&#233;normes canons primaires, les Ottomans bombardent les murs de Constantinople pendant des semaines. La fr&#233;quence de feu est cependant si lente que les d&#233;fenseurs peuvent r&#233;parer la majorit&#233; des dommages subis. Le 29 mai, Mehmet donne finalement l'assaut sur une portion endommag&#233;e du mur et l'emporte, les attaquants parvenant &#224; gagner les rues de la ville. Le destin de la ville est scell&#233;. Le dernier empereur, Constantin XI, meurt au combat et l'ancien empire dispara&#238;t &#224; jamais. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet conc&#232;de une journ&#233;e &#224; ses soldats pour piller la ville, ce qui est une pratique courante &#224; cette &#233;poque. Une grande partie de la population est alors massacr&#233;e, viol&#233;e ou r&#233;duite &#224; l'esclavage. Une fois leur avidit&#233; et leur luxure assouvies, Mehmet s'efforce de reb&#226;tir la ville et de la repeupler de Turcs. Malgr&#233; cet odieux "nettoyage ethnique" au d&#233;but de son r&#232;gne, Mehmet traite en g&#233;n&#233;ral correctement ses sujets non-islamiques, les autorisant &#224; pratiquer leur religion librement et leur offrant une grande autonomie locale. L'administration byzantine est en grande partie maintenue et est charg&#233;e de g&#233;rer l'Empire ottoman. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pour renforcer son contr&#244;le sur Constantinople, Mehmet fait dispara&#238;tre les derniers vestiges de l'Empire byzantin en conqu&#233;rant quelques petits Etats en Gr&#232;ce et, en 1461, il s'empare du petit Empire de Tr&#233;bizonde sur la mer Noire. Il essaie ensuite d'&#233;tendre son empire en Europe mais en 1462, il est vaincu par le prince Vlad III de Valachie, l'authentique comte Dracula et lors de la bataille de Vaslui en 1475, il conna&#238;t une s&#233;v&#232;re d&#233;faite contre le prince moldave Stefan le Grand. Ces d&#233;faites mettent fin &#224; cette campagne. Cependant, Mehmet reste tr&#232;s ambitieux. [PARAGRAPH:2]Pensant que la conqu&#234;te de Rome ferait de lui le dirigeant l&#233;gitime du d&#233;funt Empire romain, &#224; la fin de sa vie, Mehmet s'engage dans une campagne ambitieuse et t&#233;m&#233;raire pour r&#233;unir l'empire divis&#233;. La campagne commence bien : les Ottomans envahissent l'Italie et, en 1840, ils s'emparent facilement de la ville d'Otrante. Cependant, la m&#234;me ann&#233;e, une r&#233;bellion en Albanie menace les voies de ravitaillement et oblige les Ottomans &#224; diviser leurs forces. L'ann&#233;e suivante, une importante arm&#233;e chr&#233;tienne men&#233;e par le pape expulse les Ottomans d'Italie. Mehmet meurt en 1481, enterrant &#224; jamais son r&#234;ve de recr&#233;er la gloire antique de Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]De mani&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;rale, Mehmet a &#233;t&#233; appr&#233;ci&#233;. Il est reconnu pour ses succ&#232;s militaires et sa gestion s&#233;v&#232;re ; il servira ult&#233;rieurement de mod&#232;le aux sultans ottomans. La prise de Constantinople par Mehmet constitue l'un des &#233;v&#233;nements les plus importants de l'histoire occidentale, mettant fin &#224; la p&#233;riode m&#233;di&#233;vale. Ses attaques en Italie peuvent para&#238;tre ridicules mais elles n'ont finalement que peu affaibli le jeune Empire ottoman qui constituait son h&#233;ritage.</French>
		<German>[H1]Mehmed II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan des Osmanenreiches[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1432 - 1481[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mehmet II., der den Beinamen el-Fatih (der Eroberer) trug, war von 1451 bis 1481 nach Christus Sultan des Osmanenreiches. Ber&#252;hmt wurde er vor allem durch die Einnahme der Stadt Konstantinopel, die er zur Hauptstadt des Osmanischen Reiches machte, und die anschlie&#223;ende Zerschlagung des Byzantinische Reiches. Mehmet wurde 1432 in Edirne geboren, der damaligen Hauptstadt der Osmanen. Die Kriegskunst hatte ihn schon in jungen Jahren fasziniert und als er als Erwachsener zum Sultan aufstieg (1451), war er bereits gut darauf vorbereitet, den Angriff auf Konstantinopel anzuf&#252;hren. [PARAGRAPH:2]Im Laufe der tausendj&#228;hrigen Geschichte des Byzantinischen Reiches hatte Konstantinopel zahlreichen Belagerungsangriffen standgehalten. Nur ein einziges Mal wurde die Stadt tats&#228;chlich eingenommen, und zwar 1204 durch die Kreuzfahrer des Vierten Kreuzzugs. Im 15. Jahrhundert war das Byzantinische Reich jedoch nur noch ein Schatten seiner Selbst: Konstantinopel konnte zwar noch gehalten werden, aber au&#223;erhalb der Stadtmauern gab es nur noch wenige kleine Gebiete (haupts&#228;chlich Griechenland), die unter byzantinischer Kontrolle standen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet begann die Belagerung, indem er zwei Festungen auf beiden Seiten der Ebenen um die Stadt errichtete und so verhinderte, dass auf dem Seeweg Verst&#228;rkung eintreffen konnte. Als Mehmet im Jahr 1453 angriff, waren die Byzantiner deutlich in der Unterzahl: Lediglich 7.000 Defensiveinheiten standen einer Armee von etwa 100.000 T&#252;rken gegen&#252;ber. Aus dem Westen war keine Unterst&#252;tzung zu erwarten, weil die dortigen L&#228;nder aufgrund der Teilung der katholischen und orthodoxen Kirchen feindlich blieben. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mithilfe einer gigantischen primitiven Kanone nahmen die Osmanen wochenlang die Stadtmauern von Konstantinopel unter Beschuss (allerdings waren die Abst&#228;nde zwischen den einzelnen Sch&#252;ssen so gro&#223;, dass die Verteidiger den entstandenen Schaden in der Zwischenzeit bereits repariert hatten). Am 29. Mai befahl Mehmet schlie&#223;lich einen Sturmangriff auf einen besch&#228;digten Bereich der Mauer. Dieser Angriff verlief erfolgreich und die Belagerer konnten sich tats&#228;chlich Zugang zur Stadt verschaffen. Damit war das Schicksal Konstantinopels besiegelt. Der letzte byzantinische Kaiser, Konstantin XI., starb w&#228;hrend der Schlacht und das altehrw&#252;rdige Reich war f&#252;r immer ausgel&#246;scht. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet gab seinen Soldaten einen Tag Zeit, um die Stadt zu pl&#252;ndern (das war zur damaligen Zeit so &#252;blich), w&#228;hrenddessen ein gro&#223;er Teil der Bev&#246;lkerung get&#246;tet, vergewaltigt oder versklavt wurde. Nachdem seine Soldaten ihre Habgier und Wollust befriedigt hatten, setzte Mehmet alles daran, die Stadt wieder aufzubauen und mit T&#252;rken zu bev&#246;lkern. (Trotz der abscheulichen "ethnischen S&#228;uberung", die Mehmet zu Beginn seiner Regentschaft durchf&#252;hrte, behandelte er auch seine nicht islamischen Untertanen relativ gut, indem er ihnen gestattete, ihren Glauben ungehindert zu praktizieren und ihnen auch ein hohes Ma&#223; an Autonomie zugestand.) Die byzantinische Verwaltungsstruktur blieb gr&#246;&#223;tenteils intakt und hatte nun die Aufgabe, das Osmanenreich aufrechtzuerhalten. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nachdem er seine Vorherrschaft &#252;ber Konstantinopel gefestigt hatte, vernichtete Mehmet auch die letzten &#220;berreste des Byzantinischen Reiches, indem er zun&#228;chst einige kleinere Gebiete in Griechenland und 1461 das winzige Kaiserreich Trapezunt am Schwarzen Meer eroberte. Danach versuchte er, sein Reich nach Europa auszudehnen, wurde aber 1462 von Prinz Vlad III. (dem echten Graf Dracula) in der Wallachei besiegt und erlitt auch 1475 in der Schlacht von Vaslui im Kampf gegen den moldawischen Prinzen Stefan den Gro&#223;en erhebliche Verluste. Diese Niederlagen setzten seinem Feldzug in dieser Region zwar ein Ende, dessen ungeachtet verfolgte Mehmet aber weiterhin gro&#223;e Ziele - und nicht wenige davon. [PARAGRAPH:2]Da er der festen &#220;berzeugung war, durch die Eroberung Roms zum rechtm&#228;&#223;igen Herrscher des R&#246;mischen Reiches aufsteigen zu k&#246;nnen, begann Mehmet kurz vor seinem Tod noch einen weiteren ehrgeizigen, aber auch tollk&#252;hnen Feldzug, der sein geteiltes Reich einen sollte. Zun&#228;chst begann alles gut: Die Osmanen fielen in Italien ein und eroberten 1480 ohne gr&#246;&#223;ere Probleme die Stadt Otranto. Allerdings gef&#228;hrdete eine Rebellion in Albanien im selben Jahr den Nachschub der Osmanen, so dass diese gezwungen waren, ihre Truppen aufzuteilen. Und im darauf folgenden Jahr wurden die Osmanen von einer gro&#223;en p&#228;pstlichen Armee aus Italien vertrieben. Mit Mehmets Tod im Jahr 1481 endete auch sein Traum von der Wiedergeburt des alten Glanzes des R&#246;mischen Reiches. [PARAGRAPH:2]Aufgrund seiner Leistungen hat Mehmet seinen Platz in der Geschichte durchaus verdient: Seine milit&#228;rischen Erfolge und seine geradlinige Regentschaft dienten als Vorbild f&#252;r viele sp&#228;tere osmanische Sultane. Dar&#252;ber hinaus z&#228;hlt die Eroberung Konstantinopels durch Mehmet II. zu den wichtigsten Ereignissen der westlichen Geschichtsschreibung und kennzeichnete das Ende des Mittelalters. Sein Angriff auf Italien mag dagegen eher dumm gewesen sein, andererseits f&#252;gte er dem jungen Osmanischen Reich, das Mehmets Verm&#228;chtnis war, aber auch kaum nennenswerten Schaden zu.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Mehmet II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultano dell'Impero ottomano[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vissuto nel:[\BOLD] 1432 - 1481[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Storia:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Mehmet II, anche noto come el-Fatih (&#34;il Conquistatore&#34;) fu sultano dell'Impero ottomano tra il 1451 e il 1481 d.C. Egli &#232; famoso soprattutto per aver conquistato Costantinopoli, facendola diventare la capitale del suo impero e ponendo fine a quello bizantino. Mehmet nacque a Edirne, l'allora capitale dello stato ottomano, nel 1432. Sin da piccolo era affascinato dalle questioni militari e quando raggiunse l'et&#224; adulta e sal&#236; al trono di sultano (1451), Mehmet era pronto a sferrare l'attacco nel cuore di Bisanzio. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nel corso della storia millenaria dell'Impero bizantino, Costantinopoli aveva resistito a pi&#249; di un assedio. Era stata conquistata solo una volta, durante la quarta crociata, nel 1204. Ma nel quindicesimo secolo l'Impero bizantino era solo l'ombra di quel ch'era stato in passato: oltre a Costantinopoli comprendeva pochi altri territori, per lo pi&#249; in Grecia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet inizi&#242; l'assedio costruendo due fortezze ai lati delle pianure che circondavano la citt&#224;, impedendo cos&#236; l'arrivo di rinforzi dal mare. Quando sferr&#242; l'attacco, nel 1453, i Bizantini erano in terribile inferiorit&#224; numerica: soltanto 7.000 difensori contro circa 100.000 Turchi. N&#233; potevano sperare in aiuti da occidente, che era loro rimasto ostile per via dello scisma tra la chiesa cattolica e quella ortodossa. [PARAGRAPH:2]Usando degli enormi cannoni primitivi, gli Ottomani colpirono per settimane le mura di Costantinopoli (anche se la frequenza dei colpi era tanto bassa da permettere la riparazione dei danni tra un colpo e l'altro). Il 29 maggio Mehmet ordin&#242; infine l'assalto contro una sezione danneggiata delle mura. L'assalto and&#242; a buon fine e gli invasori si riversarono per le strade della citt&#224;. Il destino di Costantinopoli era segnato. L'ultimo imperatore, Costantino XI, mor&#236; in battaglia e il suo antico impero venne cancellato per sempre. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet concesse ai suoi soldati un giorno per saccheggiare la citt&#224; (pratica comune del tempo), nel corso del quale buona parte della popolazione venne massacrata, violentata o resa schiava. Quando l'avidit&#224; e la bramosia delle sue truppe si fu sedata, Mehmet comp&#236; ogni sforzo per ricostruire la citt&#224; e ripopolarla di Turchi. Nonostante questo odioso atto di pulizia etnica all'inizio del suo regno, Mehmet tratt&#242; poi bene i suoi sudditi non islamici, concedendo libert&#224; di religione e larga autonomia alle comunit&#224; locali. L'amministrazione bizantina venne preservata quasi per intero affinch&#233; gestisse l'Impero ottomano. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dopo aver consolidato il proprio controllo su Costantinopoli, Mehmet cancell&#242; l'Impero bizantino conquistando alcuni staterelli in Grecia e (1461) il piccolo Impero di Trebisonda sul Mar Nero. Egli cerc&#242; poi di espandersi in Europa, ma nel 1462 fu sconfitto dal principe Vlad III (il vero conte Dracula) di Valacchia e nella battaglia di Vaslui del 1475 fu pesantemente sconfitto dal principe moldavo Stefan. Mehmet decise perci&#242; di concludere questa campagna, ma la sua ambizione non era ancora stata placata del tutto. [PARAGRAPH:2]Credendo che la conquista di Roma l'avrebbe reso il legittimo sovrano dell'antico Impero romano, negli ultimi anni della sua vita Mehmet si imbarc&#242; in una ambiziosa quanto temeraria campagna per riunire l'impero diviso. La campagna part&#236; bene; gli Ottomani invasero l'Italia e nel 1480 conquistarono facilmente Otranto. Una ribellione in Albania nello stesso anno minacci&#242; tuttavia le linee di rifornimento all'esercito, costringendo gli Ottomani a dividersi su due fronti. L'anno successivo una grande armata cristiana guidata dal Papa respinse gli Ottomani fuori dall'Italia. Mehmet mor&#236; nel 1481, senza aver realizzato il suo sogno di ripristinare l'antica gloria di Roma. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nel complesso, la storia giudica Mehmet favorevolmente. A lui vengono riconosciuti numerosi successi militari e una guida sicura, tanto da essere preso a esempio dai sultani suoi successori. La sua conquista di Costantinopoli fu uno degli eventi pi&#249; importanti della storia dell'occidente, che tradizionalmente segna la fine del periodo medievale. La sua invasione dell'Italia potrebbe sembrare un atto sciocco, ma non ebbe gravi ripercussioni sull'Impero ottomano che aveva contribuito a forgiare.</Italian>

C. Su logro m&#225;s famoso es haber conquistado la ciudad de Constantinopla y haberla convertido en la nueva capital otomana, adem&#225;s de destruir al Imperio Bizantino en el proceso. Mehmet naci&#243; en Edirne, capital por entonces del estado otomano, en 1432. Las cuestiones militares lo fascinaron desde muy temprana edad y as&#237;, cuando ascendi&#243; al trono de sult&#225;n (en 1451), estaba preparado para emprender el ataque contra la ciudad de Constantinopla. [PARAGRAPH:2]A lo largo de sus mil a&#241;os de historia, Constantinopla hab&#237;a soportado numerosos asedios. Solo hab&#237;a sido capturada en una ocasi&#243;n, durante la Cuarta Cruzada (1204). Pero, en el siglo XV, el Imperio Bizantino no era m&#225;s que una sombra de su pasada gloria; aunque a&#250;n conservaba Constantinopla, m&#225;s all&#225; de las murallas solo pose&#237;a algunos peque&#241;os territorios. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet inici&#243; el asedio construyendo un par de fortalezas a ambos lados de los estrechos que rodean la ciudad, para de este modo impedir que recibiera refuerzos por mar. Cuando inici&#243; el ataque, los bizantinos se enfrentaron a una inferioridad num&#233;rica espantosa. Solo hab&#237;a siete mil defensores para hacer frente a un ej&#233;rcito de aproximadamente cien mil turcos. Y, adem&#225;s, no cab&#237;a esperar ayuda desde el oeste, que segu&#237;a siendo hostil a los bizantinos a causa de la separaci&#243;n entre las iglesias cat&#243;lica y ortodoxa. [PARAGRAPH:2]Usando unos enormes ca&#241;ones primitivos, los otomanos bombardearon durante semanas las murallas de la ciudad (aunque la cadencia de fuego era tan limitada que los defensores pudieron reparar gran parte del da&#241;o a medida que se produc&#237;a). Por fin, el 29 de mayo, Mehmet orden&#243; un ataque contra una secci&#243;n da&#241;ada de la muralla. El asalto se sald&#243; con &#233;xito y los atacantes lograron llegar a las calles de la ciudad. El destino de Constantinopla estaba sellado. El &#250;ltimo emperador, Constantino XI, muri&#243; en combate, y su antiqu&#237;simo imperio se extingui&#243; con &#233;l. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmet dio a sus soldados un d&#237;a para saquear la ciudad (una pr&#225;ctica muy normal en la &#233;poca), durante el que gran parte de la poblaci&#243;n fue asesinada, violada o esclavizada. Saciada la codicia y la lujuria de sus soldados, Mehmet hizo todo lo posible por reconstruir la ciudad y repoblarla con turcos. A pesar de esta odiosa &#34;limpieza &#233;tnica&#34; con la que inici&#243; su reinado, en general Mehmet trat&#243; bien a sus s&#250;bditos no isl&#225;micos y les concedi&#243; permiso para practicar su religi&#243;n libremente, adem&#225;s de concederles gran autonom&#237;a. La administraci&#243;n bizantina qued&#243; en gran parte intacta y recibi&#243; la misi&#243;n de gobernar el Imperio Otomano. [PARAGRAPH:2]Tras consolidar su control de Constantinopla, Mehmet acab&#243; con los &#250;ltimos vestigios del Imperio Bizantino con la conquista de los peque&#241;os estados de Grecia y, en 1461, del imperio de Trebisonda, en el mar Negro. A continuaci&#243;n trat&#243; de extender su imperio hacia Europa, pero fue derrotado por el pr&#237;ncipe Vlad III (el conde Dr&#225;cula hist&#243;rico) de Valaquia en 1462 y, m&#225;s tarde, en 1475, sufri&#243; un importante rev&#233;s frente al pr&#237;ncipe moldavo Stefan. Estas derrotas pusieron punto final a esta campa&#241;a. Sin embargo, Mehmet segu&#237;a teniendo ambiciones, y muchas. [PARAGRAPH:2]Creyendo que la conquista de Roma lo convertir&#237;a en el leg&#237;timo se&#241;or del Imperio Romano, al final de su vida se embarc&#243; en una ambiciosa pero absurda campa&#241;a para reunificar el imperio dividido. La campa&#241;a tuvo un buen comienzo: los otomanos invadieron Italia y, en 1480, la ciudad de Otranto fue capturada con facilidad. Sin embargo, una rebeli&#243;n en Albania sucedida el mismo a&#241;o amenaz&#243; sus l&#237;neas de abastecimiento y oblig&#243; a los otomanos a dividir sus fuerzas. Al a&#241;o siguiente, un nutrido ej&#233;rcito dirigido por el Papa los expuls&#243; de Italia. Mehmet muri&#243; en 1481 y con &#233;l se perdi&#243; para siempre el sue&#241;o de reconquistar la ancestral gloria de Roma. [PARAGRAPH:2]En conjunto, la historia ha deparado a Mehmet un juicio favorable. Se le reconoce su &#233;xito como militar y su firmeza como gobernante, y los posteriores sultanes otomanos lo tomar&#237;an como ejemplo. La conquista de Constantinopla por Mehmet fue uno de los acontecimientos m&#225;s importantes de la historia del mundo occidental, y representa el final de la era medieval. Puede que su ataque a Italia fuera absurdo, pero al fin y al cabo no hizo apenas da&#241;o al joven Imperio Otomano, que ser&#237;a su legado.</Spanish>

[PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed began the siege by constructing a pair of fortresses on both sides of the straights surrounding the city, thus preventing reinforcement by sea. When Mehmed attacked in 1453, the Byzantines were horribly outnumbered: there were only 7000 defenders to meet an army of roughly 100,000 Turks. Help was not forthcoming from the West, which remained hostile to the Byzantines because of the split between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. [PARAGRAPH:2]Using enormous primitive cannon, the Ottomans battered the walls of Constantinople for weeks (although the rate of fire was so slow that the defenders were able to repair much of the damage as it took place). On May 29 Mehmed finally ordered an assault at a damaged section of the walls. The assault was successful, and the attackers succeeded in breaking into the city streets. The city's fate was sealed. The last Emperor, Constantine XI, died in battle, and the ancient empire was extinguished forever. [PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed gave his soldiers a day to loot the city (which was a customary practice at the time), during which a large portion of the populace was slaughtered, raped, or enslaved. After his soldiers' greed and lust were sated, Mehmed made every effort to rebuild the city and repopulate it with Turks. (Despite this odious "ethnic cleansing" at the beginning of his reign, Mehmed generally treated his non-Islamic subjects well, granting them permission to practice their religion freely, as well as a great deal of local autonomy.) The Byzantine administration was largely preserved intact and was given the task of running the Ottoman Empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Upon consolidating his control over Constantinople, Mehmed finished off the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire by conquering some small states in Greece and in 1461 he conquered the tiny Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea. He then tried to extend his empire into Europe, but in 1462 he was defeated by Prince Vlad III (the real Count Dracula) of Wallachia, and at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475 he suffered a major loss to the Moldavian Prince Stefan. These defeats put an end to that campaign. However, Mehmed still had ambition - and plenty of it. [PARAGRAPH:2]Believing that his conquest of Rome made him the legitimate ruler of the late Roman Empire, at the end of his life Mehmed embarked on an ambitious but foolhardy campaign to reunite his divided empire. The campaign began well; the Ottomans invaded Italy, and in 1840 the city of Otranto was easily captured. However, a rebellion in Albania the same year threatened the Ottoman supply lines, forcing the Ottomans to divide their forces. The following year a large Christian army led by the pope pushed the Ottomans from Italy. Mehmed died in 1481, putting an end forever to his dream of recapturing the ancient glory of Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]In large, history has judged Mehmed kindly. He is recognized for his military success and his strong rule, and later Ottoman sultans would seek to follow his example. Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was one of the most important events in Western history, signifying the end of the medieval period. His attack upon Italy may have been foolish, but it ultimately did little to harm the young Ottoman Empire that was his legacy.</Portuguese>

Die Seehoheit der Osmanen im Mittelmeer trug ebenfalls zu S&#252;leymans Wirtschaftsreich bei, und der Korsar Barbarossa schickte unz&#228;hlige europ&#228;ische Schiffe auf den Meeresboden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Es war jene Lust auf Expansion, die Europa erzittern lie&#223;.

		<English>[H1]Maria Theresa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Archduchess of Austria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] May 13, 1717 - November 29, 1780 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maria Theresa was the eldest daughter of Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel and Emperor Charles VI who allowed her to succeed the Habsburg Monarchy. Her transition to the throne was all but simple. Opposition to her succession to the throne led to the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. After Emperor Charles VII, who claimed the throne, died in 1745, Maria Theresa claimed the throne for her husband, Francis I. She was technically the empress consort, but was the de facto ruler of the nation. In 1745, she also began styling herself as the Holy Roman Empress.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria Theresa helped commence financial and educational reforms, promoted commerce, agriculture, and reorganized the army. Many of her actions strengthened Austria as a whole and its resources. After a continuous conflict with Prussia, the Seven Years' War and eventually to the War of the Bavarian Succession. She became the dowager empress after the death of Francis and succession of her son Joseph as emperor in 1765. Maria Theresa brought unity to the Habsburg Monarchy and is considered one of its most talented rulers.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Bavaria and France posed a continuous threat to Austria, it was Frederick the Great who became Maria's primary foe during her reign. Maria Theresa focused the majority of her policies towards the defeat or Prussia. Because of these reforms, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave the Austrian Netherlands back to Maria Theresa. In exchange, Maria ceded Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla to the Infante Philip of Spain. After being defeated in the First and Second Silesian Wars, Maria Theresa began to modernize her realms with the assistance of Freidrich Wilhelm Graf von Gaugwitz. Of her many reforms, she increased the size of the army by 200% and increased taxes to guarantee a steady income for the military. She also centralized the government by combining the Austrian and Bohemian chancelleries into one administrative office.[PARAGRAPH:2]Like other Habsburgs, Maria Theresa was a devout Roman Catholic. She was educated by Jesuits at Mariazell, and in later life was short of the religious pessimism of other royal figures of her time. Her conservative outlook involved a poor view of other faiths. In 1741, she expelled the Jewish people from Prague.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria Theresa dropped Great Britain as an ally and allied herself with Russia and France. When she felt her army was strong enough, she prepared an attack on Prussia in 1756. However, it was Frederick II who attacked first, invading Saxony and starting the Seven Years' War. When Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of Hubertsburg in 1763, the war ended recognizing Prussia as the owner of most of Silesia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After her husband's death in 1765, Maria Theresa became separated from her people. Her focus changed to maintaining peace, rather than regaining Silesia. She named her son, Joseph II, as coregent and Emperor. However, he received limited powers because she felt he was too haughty for the full responsibilities. In 1767, Maria Theresa was infected with smallpox. However, she recovered and became a strong supporter of inoculation. In her later years, she focused on reforming laws along the lines of enlightened absolutism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1771, she and Joseph II issued to Robot Patent, a reform that regulated the serf's payments in her lands. Other reforms included outlawing witch-burning and torture, and taking capital punishment the off the penal code. In 1772, Maria Theresa founded the Imperial and Royal Academy of Science and Literature in Brussels. Mandatory education was introduced in 1774 in order to form an educated class of citizens, from which civil servants were recruited. Maria Theresa continued issuing various police laws throughout Austria. She died in 1780 in Vienna, being the only female to rule the Habsburg Dynasty, which lasted 650 years. Her son Joseph II was her successor.</English>

(auch Philipp von Rouvres genannt), 1361 jung gestorben war, bevor er mit seiner jungen Frau, Margarete von Flandern, die Ehe hatte vollziehen k&#246;nnen.[PARAGRAPH:2]1369 heiratete Philipp seinerseits Margarete, was ihm 1384, beim Tod seines Schwiegervaters, Graf Ludwigs II. von Flandern, dessen gro&#223;e Besitzungen einbrachte, zu denen seit 1361 auch die zum Deutschen Reich geh&#246;rende Freigrafschaft Burgund z&#228;hlte.[PARAGRAPH:2]1385 schaffte es Philipp, in Flandern Frieden zu schlie&#223;en mit den von England unterst&#252;tzten aufst&#228;ndischen St&#228;dten, vor allem Gent, Br&#252;gge und Ypern, nachdem diese am 27. November 1382 in der Schlacht bei Roosebeke entscheidend geschw&#228;cht worden waren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ebenfalls 1385 gelang es ihm in der Doppelhochzeit von Cambrai, seinen &#228;ltesten Sohn, den sp&#228;teren Johann Ohnefurcht, mit Margarete, der Tochter von Herzog Albrecht I. von Straubing-Holland, zu verheiraten und seine eigene Tochter Margarete mit dessen Sohn und Erben, dem sp&#228;teren Wilhelm II.[PARAGRAPH:2]Inzwischen (1380) hatte er nach dem Tod seines &#228;ltesten Bruders, K&#246;nigs Karl V. von Frankreich zusammen mit seinen beiden anderen Br&#252;dern, den Herz&#246;gen von Anjou und Berry die Regentschaft (Regierung der Herz&#246;ge) f&#252;r seinen noch unm&#252;ndigen Neffen Karl VI. &#252;bernommen. Nachdem dieser 1388 selbst die Herrschaft angetreten und sich mit t&#252;chtigen Ministern aus dem einstigen Stab seines Vaters umgeben hatte, wurden Philipp und seine beiden Br&#252;der weitgehend entmachtet. Sie, und zwar vor allem der energische Philipp, kehrten jedoch an die Schalthebel zur&#252;ck, als 1392 Karl VI. unter geistigen St&#246;rungen zu leiden begann. Allerdings fand Philipp bei seinem Bestreben, die Ressourcen der franz&#246;sischen Krone f&#252;r seine eigenen, oft verschwenderischen Zwecke auszubeuten, nun einen Rivalen in Gestalt von Karls ehrgeizigem, ebenfalls prunks&#252;chtigen j&#252;ngeren Bruder, Herzog Ludwig von Orl&#233;ans, der von der K&#246;nigin und offiziellen Regentin, Isabeau, gest&#252;tzt wurde.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Rivalit&#228;t zwischen Philipp und Ludwig am Hof f&#252;hrte zu Machtk&#228;mpfen, die sich ins Land hinein verl&#228;ngerten. Sie gingen nach dem Tod Philipps unter seinem Sohn und Nachfolger Johann Ohnefurcht weiter, um nach der Ermordung Ludwigs (1407) in b&#252;rgerkriegsartige Auseinandersetzungen einzum&#252;nden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philipp hatte sich zeit seines Lebens mehr als Mitglied der franz&#246;sischen K&#246;nigsfamilie und als F&#252;rst in Frankreich gef&#252;hlt denn als Herrscher &#252;ber ein relativ gro&#223;es und fast selbst&#228;ndiges Territorium zwischen Frankreich und dem Deutschen Reich. Er starb jedoch 1404 symboltr&#228;chtig im Hennegau, das hei&#223;t auf dem Boden des Reiches, in das hinein seine Nachfolger Johann (?1419), Philipp (?1467) und Karl (?1477) vor allem zu expandieren versuchten, wobei sie ihr Territorium praktisch zu einem eigenen Staat ausbauten.</German>

		<English>[H1]Simeon I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tsar of Bulgaria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 864 - May 27, 927 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Simeon was born in 864 as the third son of Knyaz Boris I. Simeon was born to a Christianized Bulgaria due to his father's reign. In his early years, Simeon learned the Greek language and received a theological education in Constantinople. Although Simeon's brother Vladimir was the designated heir of Boris, he was deposed after attempting to reintroduce paganism to Bulgaria and Simeon became king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, the Bulgarian marketplace was moved from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The merchants then required protection from Simeon, who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 894. However, the Bulgarian army was required back in the country after a Magyar invasion from the north. Later, the Magyars were convinced by the Byzantines to attack Bulgaria. Simeon, being unaware of this agreement, met another force of Byzantines from Italy. After agreeing to peace with the Byzantine commander, Simeon blocked off the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube. Simeon, after hearing of the Magyar attack, moved to confront them. The Magyars defeated Bulgaria and later pillaged its land, and Simeon agreed to peace with Byzantium in 895.[PARAGRAPH:2]Now that the Byzantine threat was abolished, Simeon planned a campaign against the Magyars. Simeon defeated the Magyars and expanded Bulgarian territory. Simeon then defeated a Byzantine army after a dispute about Bulgarian prisoners in Thrace. The war ended and Byzantium was required to pay an annual tribute and cede lands to Bulgaria.

		<German>[H1]Yaqub al-Mansur[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Kalif der Almohaden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 1160 - 1199 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Yaqub al-Mansur wurde schon unter der Regierung seines Vaters Abu Yaqub Yusuf I. (1163-1184) zum Wesir ernannt und residierte in Sevilla. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters konnte er mit Hilfe des Clans von Abu Hafs Umar seine Herrschaft durchsetzen und die Revolten seiner Br&#252;der und seines Onkels niederschlagen. In Andalusien operierten die Almohaden weiterhin erfolgreich gegen die Christen. So gelang Yaqub al-Mansur am 19. Juli 1195 bei Alarcos ein gro&#223;er Sieg &#252;ber Kastilien. 1197 erfolgte ein Vorsto&#223; bis nach Madrid und Guadalajara. Damit wurde f&#252;r einige Jahre die Expansion der Christen nach S&#252;den gestoppt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Weniger erfolgreich als in Andalusien war Yaqub al-Mansur bei der Verteidigung des Reiches in Ifriqiya und Tripolitanien, wo es erneut zu K&#228;mpfen mit dem S&#246;ldnerf&#252;hrer Qaraqusch kam. Verh&#228;ngnisvoller war aber der Aufstand der Banu Ghanija in Ifriqiya. Angeh&#246;rige dieses Stammes waren von den Almoraviden als Statthalter auf den Balearen eingesetzt worden, als welche sie die Herrschaft der Almohaden nicht anerkannten. 1184 landeten diese unter Ali, von den Balearen kommend, mit einem Heer in Bourgie und verb&#252;ndeten sich mit den Beduinen der Banu Hilal in Ifriqiya. Zwar wurden sie von den Almohaden mehrmals geschlagen, doch konnte der Aufstand nie endg&#252;ltig unterdr&#252;ckt werden. Als Yahya 1195 die F&#252;hrung der Aufst&#228;ndischen &#252;bernahm und Qaraqusch beseitigte, begann ein verheerender Kleinkrieg, der Ifriqiya, Tripolitanien und weite Teile Algeriens schwer verw&#252;stete und zum Ruin der Wirtschaft f&#252;hrte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auch wenn unter Yaqub al-Mansur der Philosoph Ibn Ruschd/ Averroes wegen h&#228;retischer Ansichten zeitweise in die Verbannung geschickt wurde, wurden Kunst und Kultur weiter gef&#246;rdert. Vor allem wurde eine umfangreiche Baut&#228;tigkeit betrieben. So erfolgte neben dem Bau der Qasba von Marrakesch unter anderem die Vollendung der Gro&#223;en Moschee in Sevilla, das zur Residenz der Almohaden in Andalusien ausgebaut wurde. Die Hasan-Moschee in Rabat konnte dagegen nicht vollendet werden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Yaqub al-Mansur erkrankte w&#228;hrend eines Feldzuges in Andalusien und bestimmte vor seinem Tod im Januar 1199 Muhammad an-Nasir (1199-1213) zu seinem Thronfolger. Yaqub al-Mansur wurde in Tinmallal / Tinmal bestattet.</German>

He also ruled a vast empire in the Americas, including New Spain and Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip's policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic self-interest. He found himself by default the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the Ottoman Turks and against the forces of the Protestant Reformation. He never relented from his war against heresy, preferring to fight on every front at whatever cost rather than countenance heterodoxy within his territories. These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where the Protestant heresy had taken deep root. Following the Revolt of the Netherlands in 1568, Philip waged a long war for control of the Netherlands, which dragged in the English and the French and lasted for the rest of his life. In 1588, the Spanish armada was destroyed by a tempest off the southern cost of Ireland, thus thwarting his planned invasion of England. Concerned with the Muslim threat in the Mediterranean, Philip achieved a decisive victory against the Turks at the Lepanto in 1571, where the fleet of the Holy League was commanded by his illegitimate brother John of Austria. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of Portugal in 1580.[PARAGRAPH:2]After basing himself in the Netherlands in the early years of his reign, Philip returned to the peninsula in 1559 and never left it again. Unlike his father, Charles V, Philip was thoroughly Spanish, a native speaker who chose to rule from Spain rather than to travel constantly around his states. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority. Spain was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the Crown of Castile. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word was less authoritarian than British or French historians have always tried to characterize. The Kingdom of Aragon, where Philip was obliged to put down a rebellion in 1591&#150;1592, was particularly unruly. He also grappled with the intractable problem of the large Morisco population in Spain, persuaded to convert to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1568, a Morisco Revolt broke out in the southern province of Granada in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs, and Philip wisely decided the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite its immense dominions, Spain itself was an arid country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown. Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns not only by taxing the local resources of his empire, but also the flow of income from the New World proved vital to his militant foreign policy. His exchequer several times was able to avoid bankruptcy. Philip's reign saw an extraordinary flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, part of what is called the Golden Age, creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts.</English>

		<German>[H1]Philipp II.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]K&#246;nig von Spanien[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 21. Mai 1527 - 13. September 1598 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Philipp II. (spanisch Felipe II) erbte als &#228;ltester und einzig &#252;berlebender legitimer Sohn Karls V. (Karl I. von Spanien) und Isabellas von Portugal 1556 das K&#246;nigreich von Spanien, die amerikanischen Kolonien, die Niederlande, die Freigrafschaft Burgund, das K&#246;nigreich beider Sizilien, das K&#246;nigreich Sardinien und das Herzogtum Mailand. Nach ihm benannte Ruy L&#243;pez de Villalobos 1543 zuerst die Insel Leyte als "Las Islas Filipinas", eine Bezeichnung, die sp&#228;ter auf den gesamten Archipel ausgeweitet wurde und dem Inselstaat der Philippinen ihren Namen gab. 1580 wurde er als Philipp I. auch K&#246;nig von Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bis zum siebten Lebensjahr wuchs Philipp bei seiner Mutter und Schwester auf. Bis zu seinem sechsten Lebensjahr konnte er - un&#252;blich f&#252;r damalige Herrscherh&#228;user - weder lesen noch schreiben. Als dies seinem Vater zu Kenntnis kam, engagierte dieser Don Jan de Zuniga, um den Jungen in strengem spanischem Sinn zu erziehen. Sein Vater, Karl V., war in seiner gesamten Regierungszeit nur etwa zehn Jahre in Spanien. Dieses war einer der Gr&#252;nde, warum Philipp in Spanien aufwuchs. Sein Vater musste auf das Kernland seiner Macht, Spanien, besondere R&#252;cksicht nehmen. Der Vater versuchte seinem Sohn in ausf&#252;hrlichen Briefen mitzuteilen, was er ansonsten in pers&#246;nlichen Gespr&#228;chen getan h&#228;tte und gab diesem vielf&#228;ltige Ratschl&#228;ge das zuk&#252;nftige Leben betreffend. Das Bildungs- und Erziehungsprogramm des Sch&#252;lers Philipp war breit gef&#228;chert. Er galt als gebildeter Mensch. Insbesondere das Lesen hatte es ihm angetan. Seine Privatbibliothek umfasste zuletzt mehr als 13.500 B&#228;nde. Weniger geschickt war Philipp im Umgang mit Fremdsprachen. Er sprach kaum Deutsch und Franz&#246;sisch, was sich negativ auswirken sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Von 1580 an war Philipp II. als Philipp I. auch K&#246;nig von Portugal, nachdem er sich dort gegen den selbsternannten Gegenk&#246;nig Ant&#243;nio von Crato hatte durchsetzen k&#246;nnen. Philipp II. erkannte 1554 Don Juan de Austria als seinen Halbbruder an, nachdem dies bereits sein Vater Kaiser Karl V. im Geheimen getan hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philipps erste Frau war (die von seinem Vater auserw&#228;hlte) Prinzessin Maria von Portugal, die er 1543 ehelichte und mit der er einen Sohn, Don Carlos, hatte. Die beiden hatten sich schon seit ihrer Kindheit gekannt, f&#252;r die Hochzeit war der Dispens des Papstes notwendig. Diese Heirat vereinigte 1580 bis 1640 Portugal mit Spanien. Sp&#228;ter machte man die nahe Verwandtschaft der Eltern (sie waren Cousin und Cousine) f&#252;r die geistige und k&#246;rperliche Behinderung ihres Sohnes verantwortlich. Die junge Mutter war bei der Geburt von den Helferinnen so schwer verletzt worden, dass sie zu fiebern begann. Es begann ein Kompetenzstreit zwischen den portugiesischen &#196;rzten, denen die junge Mutter vertraute, und die Schwitzpackungen verordneten, und den spanischen &#196;rzten, die auf Eiswasserb&#228;der setzten. Als Maria auf dem Totenbett lag, wollte allerdings keiner der &#196;rzte die Verantwortung f&#252;r die Verschlechterung ihres Zustandes auf sich nehmen. Nach ihrem Tod wurde das Ger&#252;cht ausgestreut, dass sich die W&#246;chnerin heimlich Zitronen besorgt habe und am unerlaubten Genuss dieser Fr&#252;chte gestorben sei.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach Marias Tod am 12. Juli 1545 strebte er vorerst neuerlich eine Heirat mit einer Portugiesin an, heiratete jedoch auf dringlichen Wunsch seines Vaters, der ein B&#252;ndnis mit dem K&#246;nigreich England anstrebte, am 25. Juli 1554 die katholische K&#246;nigin Maria I. von England - die Cousine seines Vaters, also seine Tante zweiten Grades - auch als Maria Tudor oder Bloody Mary bekannt. Diese Ehe war bei ihren Untertanen unbeliebt und, soweit es Philipp betraf, eine rein politische Allianz. W&#228;hrend der Dauer der Ehe f&#252;hrte er den Titel K&#246;nig von England. Am 16. Januar 1556 folgte Philipp nach der Abdankung seines Vaters Karl auf den spanischen Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]W&#228;hrend Philipps Regentschaft wurden die philippinischen Inseln erobert und nach ihm benannt; au&#223;erdem wurde eine spanische Kolonie in Florida etabliert. Seine Herrschaft war durch finanzielle Instabilit&#228;ten gekennzeichnet und durch K&#228;mpfe gegen das Osmanisches Reich um die Vorherrschaft im Mittelmeerraum, die durch die Seeschlacht von Lepanto zugunsten der Spanier und Venezianer entschieden wurden. Auch der Konflikt mit England und den Niederlanden wuchs best&#228;ndig an. Die Republik der Sieben Vereinigten Niederlande, die Nachfolgerin der Utrechter Union von 1579, erkl&#228;rte sich 1581 vom spanischen K&#246;nig unabh&#228;ngig. W&#228;hrenddessen erbte Philipp den portugiesischen Thron, und seine Erfolge w&#228;hrend der Kolonisation Amerikas verbesserten seine finanzielle Situation, was ihm erlaubte, gr&#246;&#223;eren Druck auf seine Feinde auszu&#252;ben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gesundheitlich plagte Philipp II. die Gicht. Diese sehr schmerzhafte Krankheit zwang ihn schlie&#223;lich, die letzten drei Jahre seines Lebens im Bett oder einem Rollstuhl zu verbringen. Philipp II. starb am 13. September 1598 um 5 Uhr morgens im El Escorial bei Madrid, sein Nachfolger wurde sein Sohn als K&#246;nig Philipp III. von Spanien.</German>

He also grappled with the intractable problem of the large Morisco population in Spain, persuaded to convert to Christianity by his predecessors.

He also ruled a vast empire in the Americas, including New Spain and Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip's policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic self-interest. He found himself by default the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the Ottoman Turks and against the forces of the Protestant Reformation. He never relented from his war against heresy, preferring to fight on every front at whatever cost rather than countenance heterodoxy within his territories. These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where the Protestant heresy had taken deep root. Following the Revolt of the Netherlands in 1568, Philip waged a long war for control of the Netherlands, which dragged in the English and the French and lasted for the rest of his life. In 1588, the Spanish armada was destroyed by a tempest off the southern cost of Ireland, thus thwarting his planned invasion of England. Concerned with the Muslim threat in the Mediterranean, Philip achieved a decisive victory against the Turks at the Lepanto in 1571, where the fleet of the Holy League was commanded by his illegitimate brother John of Austria. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of Portugal in 1580.[PARAGRAPH:2]After basing himself in the Netherlands in the early years of his reign, Philip returned to the peninsula in 1559 and never left it again. Unlike his father, Charles V, Philip was thoroughly Spanish, a native speaker who chose to rule from Spain rather than to travel constantly around his states. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority.

He energetically promoted trade and shipping, left a national heritage of fine buildings, and won repute as a plucky, hard-drinking man of grim wit and great resource.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian, the son of Frederick II of Denmark and Sophia of Mecklenburg, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father in 1588, but until his coronation in 1596 his country was governed by a regency of four members of the Rigsrad, the privy council, who also supervised his education. He was brought up as a Lutheran and studied Latin, French, Italian, and German as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, military command, fencing, and dancing.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his coronation Christian succeeded in limiting the powers of the Rigsrad. He kept the most important offices vacant and surrounded himself with an entourage of aristocratic young officers and German officials drawn mainly from his dukedom of Holstein. The Rigsrad was opposed to a war against Sweden, but Christian threatened to declare war in his capacity as duke of Schleswig-Holstein, thus forcing the Rigsrad to sanction plans for a war (1611-13), with the aim of once more uniting Sweden with Denmark. Although Christian won the war, his victory remained essentially inconclusive.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the war Christian centred his efforts on the economic development of his kingdom; he founded new towns, particularly ports to strengthen defenses, enlarged the royal shipyards, and built beautiful buildings and castles in and around Copenhagen. When the Protestant cause in northern Germany was endangered, in 1624, Christian entered the Thirty Years' War, again in opposition to his councillors. His aims were to protect Danish interests in northern Germany, to stop the Swedish king from playing a role in European politics, and to take up the legacy of his father and grandfather as the leading member of the Lutheran Church and its defender against expanding Catholicism. In 1625 he began operations against the Catholic League in Germany led by Tilly, the Bavarian commander in chief, who defeated him at Lutter am Barenberge on Aug. 17, 1626. Tilly's and Wallenstein's troops next invaded and plundered Jutland, thus forcing Christian to form an alliance with the Swedish king Gustavus II Adolphus against the Catholics. After the Swedish-Danish army and fleet had forced Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund, however, Christian severed the alliance and concluded a separate peace with the Holy Roman emperor at L&#252;beck in May 1629. Though Christian's prestige and even his faith in himself as a great captain were diminished, he had not lost any lands. After the war he continued to try to impede Swedish progress in northern Germany and to maintain his rights in the Baltic and the North Sea. He repeatedly raised the shipping tolls through The Sound into the Baltic in order to augment his income independently of the Rigsrad, but he thus alienated his old allies, the sea powers of England and the Netherlands. With the help of the Netherlands, Sweden attacked Denmark in December 1643; and, by the end of January 1644, Jutland was in their possession. Christian led the defense personally, blockading the Swedish ships for a time, and lost an eye in the naval battle of Kolberger Heide. Although this battle was inconclusive, the Danish fleet was later annihilated by the combined navies of Sweden and Holland, and Christian was compelled to conclude a humiliating peace in August 1645 that cost him possessions in the Baltic, Norway, and Scania. Throughout his reign the Rigsrad and the nobility had opposed his warlike policies and the ensuing strain on finances, and after this defeat even Christian's sons-in-law turned against him, forcing him to accept the increased power of the nobility. Though he died a bitter and broken man, Christian IV had ruled his kingdom for more than 50 years and is remembered as one of the most popular of Danish kings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian IV was inclined to occupy himself with every minor detail of his administration while losing sight of the larger problems. Not only did he personally lay down the lines of Denmark's mercantilistic policy, he even established the import duties; he started state-subsidized and privileged trading companies and manufacturies-all of them with no marked success-and insisted on auditing their accounts personally. He founded a new academy for young noblemen, provided funds for the students at the university and built them a new college, personally examined the knowledge of Latin and the religious orthodoxy of the clergymen due for promotion, made designs for new types of guns and tested them himself, inspected the contents of the new arsenals, acted as a judge even in minor cases, and tried out the new ships of his navy. Christian was a great builder and founder of cities. He founded the towns of Kristiania (now Oslo) and Kristiansand in Norway; Kristianstad and Kristianopel in what is now Sweden; Christianshavn in Denmark; and Gl&#252;ckstadt (which was to compete with Hamburg) in Holstein. Evidence of his unremitting industry are his more than 3,000 handwritten letters still preserved, written in an imaginative and vivid Danish prose and teeming with orders and questions on all subjects from the eternal laws of God to the brewing of stronger beer.</English>

		<German>[H1]Christian IV.[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]K&#246;nig von D&#228;nemark und Norwegen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 12. April 1577 - 28. Februar 1648 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Christian IV. war K&#246;nig von D&#228;nemark und Norwegen von 1588 bis 1648. In seiner langen Regierungszeit versuchte er wiederholt erfolglos durch kriegerische Mittel den d&#228;nisch-norwegischen Staat zu einer Gro&#223;macht zu formen. Als innenpolitischer Reformer legte er jedoch den Grundstein zur Etablierung des Absolutismus und hinterlie&#223; durch seine rege Baut&#228;tigkeit die St&#228;dte Kristiansand, Kristianstad und Gl&#252;ckstadt sowie Christianshavn - heute ein Stadtteil von Kopenhagen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian IV. war der &#228;lteste Sohn Friedrichs II. von D&#228;nemark und Norwegen und seiner Gemahlin Sophie von Mecklenburg, einer Nachfahrin Johanns I. von D&#228;nemark, die auch w&#228;hrend seiner Unm&#252;ndigkeit gemeinsam mit Vertretern des Reichsrats die Regierungsgesch&#228;fte f&#252;hrte. Sie war Vormund in den Herzogt&#252;mern, der Regierungsrat mit dem Reichsrat Vormund in D&#228;nemark. Das Verh&#228;ltnis zwischen den beiden Vorm&#252;ndern war gespannt bis feindselig.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian wurde nominell K&#246;nig nach dem Tod seines Vaters 1588. Mit &#220;bernahme der Regierung zum Datum seiner Vollj&#228;hrigkeit am 17. August 1596 und seiner feierlichen Kr&#246;nung am 29. August 1596 leitete er eine &#196;ra der Reformen ein. So betrieb er, stets die zuk&#252;nftige Ausrichtung D&#228;nemarks als Milit&#228;rmacht im Blick, eine nationale Aufr&#252;stung und lie&#223; im gesamten Reich neue Festungen erbauen. Zudem richtete er einen repr&#228;sentativen Hof ein und f&#246;rderte die Seefahrt. Symbol f&#252;r letzteres wurde eine Seereise des jungen K&#246;nigs 1599, bei der er das Nordkap umrundete und in Lappland an Land ging.[PARAGRAPH:2]1611 brach der Kalmarkrieg zwischen D&#228;nemark und Schweden aus. Christian gelang es die Schw&#228;che des schwedischen K&#246;nigs Karl IX. zu nutzen, um Schweden gro&#223;e Gebiete abzunehmen und im Januar 1613 im Frieden von Kn&#228;red die gesamte Finnmark zu erhalten. Das innenpolitische Ziel im Verlauf dieses Krieges ein stehendes Heer aufzustellen scheiterte am Widerstand des d&#228;nischen Adels.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Kalmarkrieg wandte sich Christian Norddeutschland zu. Er versuchte, an der Elbe Gebiete zu gewinnen und zwei seiner S&#246;hne die s&#228;kularisierten Bist&#252;mer Bremen und Verden zu verschaffen. Nachdem 1618 der Drei&#223;igj&#228;hrige Krieg ausgebrochen war, bem&#252;hte sich Christian 1625 erfolgreich um die Wahl zum Obersten des Nieders&#228;chsischen Reichskreises. Nach Niederlagen gegen Tilly und Wallenstein konnte Christian im L&#252;becker Frieden von 1629 seine Gebiete im Reich sichern. In den folgenden Jahren bem&#252;hte der d&#228;nische K&#246;nig sich vor allem, den unter Gustav Adolf wachsenden schwedischen Einfluss einzud&#228;mmen. Dies f&#252;hrte 1643 zum Torstenssonkrieg. Er endete 1645 mit dem Frieden von Br&#246;msebro, in dem D&#228;nemark gro&#223;e Gebiete an Schweden abgeben musste. Christians letzte Regierungs- und Lebensjahre waren vom &#220;bergang der Herrschaft im Ostseeraum an Schweden und vom wachsenden Einfluss des Adels im Inneren D&#228;nemarks bestimmt.</German>

		<Portuguese>[H1]Christian IV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Denmark and Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] April 12, 1577 - February 28, 1648 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]King of Denmark and Norway (1588-1648), who led two unsuccessful wars against Sweden and brought disaster upon his country by leading it into the Thirty Years' War. He energetically promoted trade and shipping, left a national heritage of fine buildings, and won repute as a plucky, hard-drinking man of grim wit and great resource.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian, the son of Frederick II of Denmark and Sophia of Mecklenburg, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father in 1588, but until his coronation in 1596 his country was governed by a regency of four members of the Rigsrad, the privy council, who also supervised his education. He was brought up as a Lutheran and studied Latin, French, Italian, and German as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, military command, fencing, and dancing.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his coronation Christian succeeded in limiting the powers of the Rigsrad. He kept the most important offices vacant and surrounded himself with an entourage of aristocratic young officers and German officials drawn mainly from his dukedom of Holstein. The Rigsrad was opposed to a war against Sweden, but Christian threatened to declare war in his capacity as duke of Schleswig-Holstein, thus forcing the Rigsrad to sanction plans for a war (1611-13), with the aim of once more uniting Sweden with Denmark. Although Christian won the war, his victory remained essentially inconclusive.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the war Christian centred his efforts on the economic development of his kingdom; he founded new towns, particularly ports to strengthen defenses, enlarged the royal shipyards, and built beautiful buildings and castles in and around Copenhagen. When the Protestant cause in northern Germany was endangered, in 1624, Christian entered the Thirty Years' War, again in opposition to his councillors. His aims were to protect Danish interests in northern Germany, to stop the Swedish king from playing a role in European politics, and to take up the legacy of his father and grandfather as the leading member of the Lutheran Church and its defender against expanding Catholicism. In 1625 he began operations against the Catholic League in Germany led by Tilly, the Bavarian commander in chief, who defeated him at Lutter am Barenberge on Aug. 17, 1626. Tilly's and Wallenstein's troops next invaded and plundered Jutland, thus forcing Christian to form an alliance with the Swedish king Gustavus II Adolphus against the Catholics. After the Swedish-Danish army and fleet had forced Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund, however, Christian severed the alliance and concluded a separate peace with the Holy Roman emperor at L&#252;beck in May 1629. Though Christian's prestige and even his faith in himself as a great captain were diminished, he had not lost any lands. After the war he continued to try to impede Swedish progress in northern Germany and to maintain his rights in the Baltic and the North Sea. He repeatedly raised the shipping tolls through The Sound into the Baltic in order to augment his income independently of the Rigsrad, but he thus alienated his old allies, the sea powers of England and the Netherlands. With the help of the Netherlands, Sweden attacked Denmark in December 1643; and, by the end of January 1644, Jutland was in their possession. Christian led the defense personally, blockading the Swedish ships for a time, and lost an eye in the naval battle of Kolberger Heide. Although this battle was inconclusive, the Danish fleet was later annihilated by the combined navies of Sweden and Holland, and Christian was compelled to conclude a humiliating peace in August 1645 that cost him possessions in the Baltic, Norway, and Scania. Throughout his reign the Rigsrad and the nobility had opposed his warlike policies and the ensuing strain on finances, and after this defeat even Christian's sons-in-law turned against him, forcing him to accept the increased power of the nobility. Though he died a bitter and broken man, Christian IV had ruled his kingdom for more than 50 years and is remembered as one of the most popular of Danish kings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian IV was inclined to occupy himself with every minor detail of his administration while losing sight of the larger problems.

He was also claimed to be the King of Denmark until 1062, often defeating King Sweyn's army and forcing him to leave the country. Many details of his life were chronicled in the Heimskringla. Among English-speakers, he is generally known as "Harold Hardrada" and remembered for his invasion of England in 1066. The death of Hardrada is often recorded as the end of the Viking era.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born in 1015, Harald was the youngest of King Olaf II's three half-brothers born to Aasta Gudbrandsdatter. When Harald was 15, King Olaf was killed, trying to take the throne back from Canute the Great in 1030 at the Battle of Stiklestad. Harald took part in the battle and although wounded managed to escape and leave Norway in exile.[NEWLINE]He was able to form a band of warriors out of men who had also been exiled as a result of Olaf's death. In 1031 Harald and his men reached the land of the Kievan Rus where they served the armies of Yaroslav I the Wise, the Grand Prince of the Rus. Harald is thought to have taken part in Grand Prince Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles and was appointed joint commander of defense forces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some years after Harald and his men had entered the land of the Rus, they packed up and left for the heart of the Byzantine Empire, the city of Constantinople. At the time, the Byzantine Empire was the wealthiest empire in Medieval Europe and the Near East. Harald and his men pledged themselves to the service of the armies of the empire. Harald's forces joined the elite mercenary unit known as the Varangian Guard. It was not long until Harald had proven himself in battle and gained the respect of his fellow guardsmen. He soon became the leader of the entire force and used this power to undertake his own missions. Harald's forces won a great many victories in North Africa, Syria and Sicily. Through ingenuity, he and his men were able to besiege and defeat a number of castles. A contemporary source reports such tactics as attaching burning resin to birds, setting the castle ablaze, digging a tunnel and feigning reluctance to fight, only to launch an attack at the most advantageous moment. Harald was able to build a large fortune in plunder from his victories.[PARAGRAPH:2]Harald took part in the suppression of the uprising of Peter Delyan, who attempted to restore the Bulgarian Empire in 1040-1041. In the Norse sagas, he is hailed as "Devastator of Bulgaria" and "Scourge of the Bulgarians" due to his participation, and is even thought to have cut down Peter Delyan in the field of battle. Some authors go as far as to theorize that Harald named Oslo after a Bulgarian he fell in love with, possibly named Slava or Oslava, though these theories are not known to have any actual base.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to Snorri Sturluson, who quoted the skald Stuf, Harald also made a raid into the country of Palestine and was able to conquer the city of Jerusalem:[NEWLINE]"Here it is told that this land came without fire and sword under Harald's command. He then went out to Jordan and bathed therein, according to the custom of other pilgrims. Harald gave great gifts to our Lord's graves, to the Holy Cross, and other holy relics in the land of Jerusalem. He also cleared the whole road all the way out to Jordan, by killing the robbers and other disturbers of the peace."[PARAGRAPH:2]This story would have made Harald the forerunner of the Crusaders, whose kingdom was a century old at the time of Snorri Sturluson - a claim of obvious prestige valued to later Norwegian monarchs. In 1225, when the saga was written, Snorri was championing the cause of the Norwegian monarchy and urging a unification of Iceland with Norway. Byzantine and Islamic sources of Harald's own time do not mention such a conquest of Jerusalem. It is, however, quite plausible that as a Christian Harald did go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his men, and that they did fight and defeat robbers infesting the pilgrims' route to the Holy City - without intending or effecting the city's conquest from the Muslims.[PARAGRAPH:2]Using the wealth he had built during his service to the Byzantine Empire, Harald returned to Norway in 1045. He brought with him a number of men who served with him, and, as a result, became an immediate threat to the sitting king, Magnus I, who was the son of Olaf II and nephew of Harald and had returned from exile in 1035 to reclaim his father's throne after the death of Canute the Great.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sturluson writes: "When Harald returned to Constantinople from Jerusalem he longed to return to the North to his native land; and when he heard that Magnus Olafson, his brother's son, had become king both of Norway and Denmark, he gave up his command in the Greek service. And when the empress Zoe heard of this she became angry and raised an accusation against Harald that he had misapplied the property of the Greek emperor which he had received in the campaigns in which he was the commander of the army. On this account the Greek emperor had Harald made prisoner and carried to prison."[PARAGRAPH:2]When he finally returned to Norway, Magnus agreed to share power with his uncle Harald and the two became co-rulers. However, it was only a year later that Magnus would die. The circumstances surrounding his death were never truly explained. Speculation and increased tension between the two rulers led to the widespread belief that Magnus was killed by Harald so that he alone would control Norway.</English>

		<German>[H1]Harald Hardr&#229;de[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]K&#246;nig von Norwegen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1015 - 25. September 1066 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Harald III. oder auch Harald Hardr&#229;de (dt. Harald der Harte) war K&#246;nig von Norwegen von 1047 bis 1066. Er war der Sohn von Sigurd II. Syr, Unterk&#246;nig von Ringerike, Hordafylke und Romerike und Halbbruder von Olav II. dem Heiligen. Seine Mutter war &#229;sta Gudbrandsdotter.[PARAGRAPH:2]1030 musste er aus Norwegen fliehen, nachdem er sich an der Schlacht von Stiklestad beteiligt hatte, bei der Olav II. fiel. Er ging zun&#228;chst nach Nowgorod in den Dienst von Jaroslaw I., danach diente er erst dem byzantinischen Kaiser Michael IV., dem Kaiser Michael V., dann der Kaiserin Zoe und am Ende dem Kaiser Konstantin IX. in der War&#228;gergarde. Ein byzantinischer Text aus dem 11. Jh., der 1881 in Moskau von einem russischen Historiker herausgegeben wurde, beschreibt seine Bedeutung in Byzanz so:[NEWLINE]"Araltes war ein Sohn des K&#246;nigs in War&#228;gien und hatte einen Bruder J&#250;lavos (= Olav), der nach dem Tode seines Vaters das v&#228;terliche Reich erbte. . Aber als Kaiser Mikhael und der nachfolgende Kaiser, sein Neffe, beide gestorben waren, wollte Araltes in der Regierungszeit des Kaisers Monokahos in sein Land nach Hause ziehen. Dies wurde ihm aber nicht gestattet, und man suchte seine Reise zu verhindern. Trotzdem konnte er heimlich fortreisen und wurde K&#246;nig in seinem Land an Stelle seines Bruders J&#250;lavos. Er war sehr gl&#252;cklich dar&#252;ber, dass er zum Manglabites und Spatharokandidatos ernannt worden war, und auch als K&#246;nig bewahrte er Treue und freundschaftliche Beziehungen zu den R&#246;mern (= Byzantinern)."[NEWLINE]Manglabites war ein h&#246;heres Mitglied der kaiserlichen Leibgarde. Er erhielt den Titel f&#252;r seinen erfolgreichen Feldzug nach Sizilien. Spatharocandidatos war der Titel eines Offiziers der kaiserlichen Leibgarde. Diesen Titel erhielt er, nachdem er den Bulgarenaufstand (1040-1041) unter Peter Deljan niedergeschlagen hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]1042 verlie&#223; er Konstantinopel, heiratete Elisabeth von Kiew, Tochter des Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten Jaroslaw I. von Kiew und kehrte nach Norwegen zur&#252;ck, um seinen Thronanspruch durchzusetzen. Er verb&#252;ndete sich zun&#228;chst mit Sven Estridsson von D&#228;nemark, &#252;berwarf sich aber mit ihm, als sein Neffe Magnus I. anbot, die Herrschaft mit ihm zu teilen. Nach dem Tod von Magnus I. war Harald alleiniger Herrscher von Norwegen. Die folgenden Jahre f&#252;hrte er dauernd Kriege und Pl&#252;nderungsz&#252;ge nach D&#228;nemark gegen Sven. Die Pl&#252;nderungsz&#252;ge waren notwendig, um sein Heer unterhalten zu k&#246;nnen.[PARAGRAPH:2]1066 starb Edward der Bekenner in England. Die Thronfolge war unklar. Der englische Earl Harald Godwinsson lie&#223; sich am Tage nach dem Tode Edwards zum K&#246;nig kr&#246;nen. Aber auch Herzog Wilhelm der Normandie und Harald Hardr&#229;de erhoben Anspruch auf die Krone. Er leitete sie aus der Nachfolge von Knut dem Gro&#223;en her. Er verb&#252;ndete sich mit dem Earl Toste, einem Bruder Harald Godwinsons. Dieser f&#252;hlte sich von seinem Bruder beiseite geschoben und wollte Northumbria zur&#252;ckgewinnen, das ihm jener genommen hatte. Harald Hardr&#229;de fuhr mit einem gro&#223;en Heer zun&#228;chst nach den Orkneys und ging ungef&#228;hr am 10. September 1066 in England an Land. Um den 20. September kam es zur Schlacht bei Fulford, die Harald &#252;berlegen gewann. York huldigte ihm am folgenden Tag. Offenbar sorglos geworden marschierte der norwegische K&#246;nig mit einem Teil seiner Armee Richtung S&#252;den und wurde am 25. September 1066 &#252;berrascht. Es kam zur Schlacht von Stamford Bridge in der N&#228;he von York gegen das Heer Harald Godwinsons. Hardr&#229;de fiel, und der Rest des Heeres musste fliehen. Inzwischen war aber Wilhelm von der Normandie aus im S&#252;den Englands ungehindert gelandet. Am 14. Oktober 1066 kam es zur Schlacht bei Hastings, in welcher Wilhelm siegte und Earl Harald fiel. Damit wurde England von Skandinavien gel&#246;st und an Frankreich gebunden.</German>

At the time, the Byzantine Empire was the wealthiest empire in Medieval Europe and the Near East. Harald and his men pledged themselves to the service of the armies of the empire. Harald's forces joined the elite mercenary unit known as the Varangian Guard. It was not long until Harald had proven himself in battle and gained the respect of his fellow guardsmen. He soon became the leader of the entire force and used this power to undertake his own missions. Harald's forces won a great many victories in North Africa, Syria and Sicily. Through ingenuity, he and his men were able to besiege and defeat a number of castles. A contemporary source reports such tactics as attaching burning resin to birds, setting the castle ablaze, digging a tunnel and feigning reluctance to fight, only to launch an attack at the most advantageous moment. Harald was able to build a large fortune in plunder from his victories.[PARAGRAPH:2]Harald took part in the suppression of the uprising of Peter Delyan, who attempted to restore the Bulgarian Empire in 1040-1041. In the Norse sagas, he is hailed as "Devastator of Bulgaria" and "Scourge of the Bulgarians" due to his participation, and is even thought to have cut down Peter Delyan in the field of battle. Some authors go as far as to theorize that Harald named Oslo after a Bulgarian he fell in love with, possibly named Slava or Oslava, though these theories are not known to have any actual base.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to Snorri Sturluson, who quoted the skald Stuf, Harald also made a raid into the country of Palestine and was able to conquer the city of Jerusalem:[NEWLINE]"Here it is told that this land came without fire and sword under Harald's command. He then went out to Jordan and bathed therein, according to the custom of other pilgrims. Harald gave great gifts to our Lord's graves, to the Holy Cross, and other holy relics in the land of Jerusalem. He also cleared the whole road all the way out to Jordan, by killing the robbers and other disturbers of the peace."[PARAGRAPH:2]This story would have made Harald the forerunner of the Crusaders, whose kingdom was a century old at the time of Snorri Sturluson - a claim of obvious prestige valued to later Norwegian monarchs. In 1225, when the saga was written, Snorri was championing the cause of the Norwegian monarchy and urging a unification of Iceland with Norway. Byzantine and Islamic sources of Harald's own time do not mention such a conquest of Jerusalem. It is, however, quite plausible that as a Christian Harald did go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his men, and that they did fight and defeat robbers infesting the pilgrims' route to the Holy City - without intending or effecting the city's conquest from the Muslims.[PARAGRAPH:2]Using the wealth he had built during his service to the Byzantine Empire, Harald returned to Norway in 1045. He brought with him a number of men who served with him, and, as a result, became an immediate threat to the sitting king, Magnus I, who was the son of Olaf II and nephew of Harald and had returned from exile in 1035 to reclaim his father's throne after the death of Canute the Great.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sturluson writes: "When Harald returned to Constantinople from Jerusalem he longed to return to the North to his native land; and when he heard that Magnus Olafson, his brother's son, had become king both of Norway and Denmark, he gave up his command in the Greek service. And when the empress Zoe heard of this she became angry and raised an accusation against Harald that he had misapplied the property of the Greek emperor which he had received in the campaigns in which he was the commander of the army. On this account the Greek emperor had Harald made prisoner and carried to prison."[PARAGRAPH:2]When he finally returned to Norway, Magnus agreed to share power with his uncle Harald and the two became co-rulers. However, it was only a year later that Magnus would die. The circumstances surrounding his death were never truly explained. Speculation and increased tension between the two rulers led to the widespread belief that Magnus was killed by Harald so that he alone would control Norway.</Portuguese>

		<German>[H1]Enrico Dandolo[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Doge von Venedig[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1107 - 21. Juni 1205 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Enrico Dandolo war der 41. Doge von Venedig. Er regierte von 1192 bis 1205. In seine Amtszeit fiel der Vierte Kreuzzug.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dandolo entstammte der prominenten venezianischen Familie der Dandolo, die insgesamt vier Dogen gestellt hat: Au&#223;er Enrico die Dogen Giovanni Dandolo, Francesco Dandolo und Andrea Dandolo. Zwei Frauen der Familie waren mit Dogen verheiratet, Giovanna Dandolo mit Pasqual Malipiero und Zilia Dandolo mit Lorenzo Priuli. Enricos Vater Vitale war ein enger Berater des Dogen Vitale II. Michiel, ein Onkel, der ebenfalls Enrico hie&#223;, war der Patriarch von Grado. Diese M&#228;nner wurden beide alt, so dass der junge Enrico bis zu seinen sechziger Jahren in ihrem Schatten stand.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dandolos erster Auftritt auf der politischen B&#252;hne fand 1171 und 1172 statt, als die byzantinische Regierung zuerst den Besitz Tausender von Venezianern konfiszierte und sie anschlie&#223;end einkerkerte (vgl. venezianische Wirtschaftsgeschichte). Durch den aufgebrachten Volkswillen hatte sich der Doge zun&#228;chst gezwungen gesehen, Truppen f&#252;r eine Vergeltungsexpedition zu sammeln. Diese fiel jedoch, durch Krankheiten im Fr&#252;hjahr 1171 dezimiert, auseinander. Stattdessen wurden Dandolo und ein anderer Botschafter zu Verhandlungen nach Konstantinopel geschickt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Er war 85 Jahre alt (oder zumindest in den sp&#228;ten Siebzigern), als er 1192 ins Amt kam und zudem blind, aber k&#246;rperlich und intellektuell au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich leistungsf&#228;hig. 1202 strandeten die Kreuzfahrer des Vierten Kreuzzuges in Venedig und waren nicht in der Lage, die vielen von Venedig angemieteten Schiffe zu bezahlen, da sich weit weniger Truppen als erwartet hatten anwerben lassen. Dandolo erkannte, dass der einzige Weg, die Schiffe vorteilhaft zu nutzen, darin lag, ein venezianisches Kontingent auf den Kreuzzug zu schicken.[PARAGRAPH:2]Urspr&#252;nglich war die direkte &#220;berfahrt nach &#196;gypten geplant, Dandolo &#252;berzeugte die Truppen jedoch, in der dalmatinischen und fr&#252;her zeitweilig von Venedig kontrollierten Hafenstadt Zadar, die unter kroatisch-ungarischer Herrschaft stand, zu landen. Viele Kreuzfahrer erahnten das Vorhaben und verweigerten ihre Hilfe. Andere lie&#223;en sich von Dandolos Versprechen, dass ihre w&#228;hrend der Wartezeit in Venedig angeh&#228;uften Schulden getilgt w&#252;rden, &#252;berzeugen. Papst Innozenz III. verbot den Angriff und exkommunizierte das gesamte Kreuzfahrerheer daf&#252;r.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zara wurde nach kurzer Belagerung am 15. November 1202 erobert und schwer verw&#252;stet. Kurz danach traf Alexios Angelus, Sohn des abgesetzten byzantinischen Kaisers Isaak II., in der Stadt ein und &#252;berzeugte die Anf&#252;hrer der Kreuzfahrer mit Dandolos Hilfe, Konstantinopel zu belagern. Sein Plan war, hierdurch auf den Thron des byzantinischen Reiches zu gelangen. Als Konstantinopel schlie&#223;lich am 12. April 1204 fiel, war Dandolo direkt beteiligt. Er war noch r&#252;stig genug, um an einer Expedition gegen die Bulgaren teilzunehmen und starb 1205. Er ist in der Hagia Sophia in Konstantinopel beigesetzt; sein Grab ist noch heute erhalten, auch wenn man es wegen seiner Kleinheit leicht &#252;bersieht.</German>

During his lengthy reign, Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural flowering and military power.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of his father Vladimir the Great, Yaroslav waged a complicated and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Boleslaw I Chrobry of Poland. During the course of this struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the Saga of Eymund is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris's assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav.[PARAGRAPH:2]Leaving aside the legitimacy of Yaroslav's claims to the Kievan throne and his postulated guilt in the murder of his brothers, Nestor the Chronicler and later Russian historians often presented him as a model of virtue, styling him "the Wise". Yaroslav was a notable patron of book culture and learning. In 1051, he had a Russian monk Ilarion proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev, thus challenging old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Ilarion's discourse on Yaroslav and his father Vladimir is frequently cited as the first work of Old Russian literature.[PARAGRAPH:2]In his foreign policy, Yaroslav relied on the Scandinavian alliance and attempted to weaken the Byzantine influence on Kiev. In 1030, he reconquered Red Rus from the Poles and concluded an alliance with King Casimir I of Poland, sealed by the latter's marriage to Yaroslav's sister Maria.[PARAGRAPH:2]To defend his state from the Pechenegs and other nomadic tribes threatening it from the south he constructed a line of forts, composed of Yuriev, Boguslav, Kaniv, Korsun, and Pereyaslav. To celebrate his decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1036 (who thereupon never were a threat to Kiev) he sponsored the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in 1037. Other celebrated monuments of his reign, such as the Golden Gates of Kiev, have since perished.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1043, Yaroslav staged a naval raid against Constantinople led by his son Vladimir and general Vyshata. Although the Rus' navy was defeated, Yaroslav managed to conclude the war with a favourable treaty and prestigious marriage of his son Vsevolod to the emperor's daughter.</English>

		<German>[H1]Jaroslaw I. der Weise[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Gro&#223;f&#252;rst von Kiew[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 979/86 - 20. Februar 1054 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Jaroslaw I. Wladimirowitsch, genannt der Weise, aus dem Geschlecht der Rurikiden, Gro&#223;f&#252;rst von Kiew (1019-1054). Sohn Wladimirs I., des Heiligen, und Rognedas von Polozk.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Rurikiden geh&#246;rten den Rus an, der skandinavischst&#228;mmigen F&#252;hrungsschicht, die sich seit der Mitte des 9. Jahrhunderts unter den Ostslawen niedergelassen und das Reich der Kiewer Rus gegr&#252;ndet hatte. Die Rurikiden waren bis zum Ende des 10. Jahrhunderts weitgehend slawisiert. Jaroslaws Vater Wladimir war 988 der erste Kiewer Gro&#223;f&#252;rst, der das Christentum annahm und damit erheblich zum Aufstieg Kiews zur ostslawischen Hegemoniemacht beitrug.[NEWLINE]Nach einer Legende soll Jaroslaw um 1010 im Kampf eine m&#228;chtige B&#228;rin bezwungen und an dieser Stelle die Stadt Jaroslawl gegr&#252;ndet haben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jaroslaw hatte von seinem Vater nach dem Tod des &#228;lteren Bruders und designierten Thronfolgers Wyscheslaw die Herrschaft &#252;ber die reiche Handelsstadt Nowgorod zugesprochen bekommen. 1014 weigerte Jaroslaw sich, seinem Vater den Tribut zu zahlen. Zu einem Feldzug Wladimirs gegen seinen Sohn kam es nicht mehr, weil Wladimir am 15. Juli 1015 starb.[PARAGRAPH:2]Daf&#252;r begannen sofort Nachfolgek&#228;mpfe zwischen Jaroslaw und seinen Br&#252;dern und Onkeln. Zun&#228;chst konnte sich Jaroslaws Halbbruder Swjatopolk mit Hilfe seines Schwiegervaters, des polnischen K&#246;nigs Boleslaw I. durchsetzen. Jaroslaw hielt sich aber in Nowgorod. Dort zog er ein Heer skandinavischer Krieger zusammen und schlug im Sp&#228;tsommer 1016 Swjatopolk. Im Sommer 1017 griffen Jaroslaw I. und Kaiser Heinrich II. einer vorherigen Absprache folgend Boleslaw I. von zwei Seiten her an. Im darauf folgenden Sommer gelang es Boleslaw, Kiew zu erobern. Jaroslaw konnte zwar nach Nowgorod fliehen, seine weiblichen Verwandten und ein gro&#223;er Goldschatz fielen jedoch in die H&#228;nde des polnischen K&#246;nigs. Kurz darauf vertrieb Jaroslaw den erneut als Gro&#223;f&#252;rst eingesetzten Swjatopolk wieder aus Kiew.[PARAGRAPH:2]Von 1029 bis 1031 wiederholte sich das Szenario von 1017: Wieder wurde Polen aus dem Westen, nun von Konrad II., und aus dem Osten von Jaroslaw angegriffen. Diesmal gelang es dem Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten, weite Gebiete mit einem wichtigen Burgeng&#252;rtel f&#252;r Kiew zu erobern und kurzzeitig den ihm genehmen &#228;ltesten Sohn des 1025 verstorbenen Boleslaws und Bruder des &#252;ber Polen herrschenden Mieszko II. Lambert, Bezprym, als Herrscher in Polen zu installieren.

After the death of Matthias&#39;s father, there was a struggle between Hungary&#39;s various barons and its Habsburg King. The gentry and the people of Pest finally came out in support of Matthias as king, while most barons also agreed to support him.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 20, 1458, Matthias was elected king by the Diet. At this time, he was the hostage of the king of Bohemia who released under the condition of marrying his daughter. Matthias was finally crowned after several wars with Bohemia and the new Emperor Frederick III gave him the Holy Crown. Only the age of 15, Matthias began his reign by building public health, education, and a new legal system. Matthias was also a fan of art and culture, as many artists were present in his court.[TAB]Matthias gained independence by dividing the barons and raising a large royal army. At this time, Hungary reached its greatest territorial extent of the era. Matthias was victorious in several campaigns against the Ottoman Empire by raising the Kingdom of Hungary to be a world power. After that, Matthias was intent in conquering large parts of the Holy Roman Empire. By the end of his reign, he was in control of places such as Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, half of Austria, and Vienna.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Vlad III Dracula, Prince of Wallachia, had many successes against the Ottoman Empire, Matthias imprisoned him after a disagreement between the two rulers. Hungary decided to help Dracula in his fight of the threatening Ottomans, but he was assassinated. This was a major blow to the position of Hungary. In 1467, a conflict arose between Matthias and the Moldavian Prince Stephen III, after he became worn out by Hungary&#39;s policies and their presence at Kilia. A revenge lead by Stephen leads to the defeat of Matthias at the Battle of Baia. Matthias died in 1490 in Vienna, Austria, and his empire collapsed after his death because of the fact that his son was not accepted as king.</English>

Vlad III riusc&#38;#236; nell&#39;impresa ma la sua fu una vittoria di Pirro, dato che un rinnovato esercito ottomano lo sconfisse e lo uccise.

In 1467, a conflict arose between Matthias and the Moldavian Prince Stephen III, after he became worn out by Hungary&#39;s policies and their presence at Kilia. A revenge lead by Stephen leads to the defeat of Matthias at the Battle of Baia. Matthias died in 1490 in Vienna, Austria, and his empire collapsed after his death because of the fact that his son was not accepted as king.</Portuguese>

His father was the Magyar chieftain Geza: his mother was Sarolt (Polish: Adelajda) from the Polish dynasty of the Piasts, and Stephen was given the name Vajk (meaning hero) at birth. Born a pagan in the town of Esztergom, Vajk was baptized, as a precondition of accepting the crown from Rome, at age 10 by Saint Adalbert of Prague, and given the baptismal name Stephen (in honor of the original early Christian Saint Stephen), protector of the church at Passau).[PARAGRAPH:2]He was married in 995 to Gizella of Bavaria (though some sources give other years for the marriage), the daughter of Henry II the Wrangler, and his wife Gisela of Burgundy. Stephen and Gizella had at least three children; we know the names of the sons Imre (Henry or Emeric) and Ott&#243; (Otto) and the daughter Hedvig (Hedwig). All of Stephen's children apparently predeceased him and left no descendants to claim the throne upon his death, so that the crown had to be contended for by his nephews and cousins.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 995 and 997, Stephen (under the name "Vajk") was the prince of Nitra (a Slovak Christian center and the capital of the Nitrian principality in present day south-western Slovakia) and was living in Nitra together with his wife.[PARAGRAPH:2]After battling and defeating the pagan nobles who opposed him (including his uncle, a powerful warlord named Kopp&#225;ny), Stephen became the Sovereign of Magyars in Transdanubia in 997 and till 1006 managed to successfully unite virtually all the Magyar clans. The victory over Kopp&#225;ny was achieved also thanks to the substantial material and military assistance from the Slovak Christian noblemen Poznan and Hunt. According to Hungarian tradition, Pope Silvester II sent a magnificent jeweled gold crown to Stephen (which became the symbol of Hungary under the name of the Holy Crown) along with an apostolic cross and a letter of blessing in the beginning of January, 1001 to officially recognize him as a Christian king of Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen divided Hungary into 40-50 counties, and continued the work of his father Geza by applying the decimal organizational system of his ancestors and setting up ten dioceses in Hungary, ordering every ten villages to erect one church and maintain a priest. He founded the cathedrals of Sz&#233;kesfeh&#233;rv&#225;r and Esztergom, the Nunnery of Veszpr&#233;m, the Benedictine Abbey of Pannonhalma, and the Monastery of Saint Peter and Paul in Buda. Inside the abbeys and monasteries, schools were established and they became important centers of culture. Saint Astricus served as Stephen's advisor, and Stephen also had Saint Gerard Sagredo as the tutor for his son Saint Emeric (Imre).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen discouraged pagan customs and strengthened Christianity with various laws, including ending the use of the old Hun-Magyar runic alphabet and making Latin the official language of the royal court. Stephen gave generously to the churches, personally visited them often, and supervised their construction. He often disguised himself as a peasant whenever he traveled, and freely gave money to any poor people he met (in one account, Stephen was beaten and robbed by a group of beggars to whom he was giving alms, but he forgave them and spared their lives).[PARAGRAPH:2]He intended to retire to a life of holy contemplation and hand the kingdom over to his only surviving son Imre, but in 1031 Imre was wounded in a hunting accident and died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen mourned a very long time over the loss of his favorite son Imre, which took a great toll on his health. He eventually recovered, but he never regained his original vitality. Having no children left, he could not find anyone among his remaining relatives who was able to rule the country competently and willing to maintain the Christian faith of the nation. Unable to choose an heir, King Stephen died at Sz&#233;kesfeh&#233;rv&#225;r (a city he built in central Hungary) on the Feast of the Assumption, and was buried there. Both his nobles and his subjects were said to have mourned for 3 straight years afterwards.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after his death, healing miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb. Stephen was canonized by the Vatican as Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1083. Catholics venerate him as the patron saint of: Hungary, kings, the death of children, masons, stonecutters, and bricklayers. His feast is on September 2, but in Hungary his chief festival is observed on August 20, the day on which his sacred relics were transferred to the city of Buda; this day is a public holiday in Hungary.[PARAGRAPH:2]His crown, known as the Holy Crown, is currently (since 2000) enshrined in the Hungarian Parliament building, in Budapest.</English>

		<German>[H1]Stephan I. der Heilige[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Erster K&#246;nig von Ungarn[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 969 - 1038[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Szent Istv&#225;n (in Deutschland auch als Stephan I. der Heilige bekannt, geb. 969 bei Esztergom, gest. 15.08.1038) aus dem Geschlecht der &#193;rp&#225;den war der erste K&#246;nig Ungarns und ist heute der Nationalheilige des Landes. Er christianisierte die heidnischen Magyaren. Sein Gedenktag ist der 20. August, der in Ungarn Nationalfeiertag ist. Die r&#246;misch-katholische Kirche gedenkt dieses Heiligen am 16. August.Zusammen mit seinem Vater G&#233;za wurde Istv&#225;n 985 von Adalbert von Prag getauft. W&#228;hrend der Gro&#223;f&#252;rst G&#233;za trotz der Taufe im Grunde Heide blieb, erhielt Istv&#225;n eine christliche Erziehung. Diese wurde noch verst&#228;rkt durch die Verheiratung Istv&#225;ns mit der bayrischen Herzogstochter Gisela. Zudem festigte die Hochzeit das B&#252;ndnis Ungarns mit den bayerischen F&#252;rsten, die noch 991 einen Feldzug gegen die Ungarn gef&#252;hrt hatten, und besiegelte die Bindung der Ungarn an die Westkirche. Als Istv&#225;n 997 die Nachfolge seines Vaters als Gro&#223;f&#252;rst antrat, war er vermutlich Christ aus &#220;berzeugung. Am Anfang seiner Herrschaft musste er sich zun&#228;chst gegen seinen Vetter Kopp&#225;ny durchsetzen, der selbst den Anspruch auf den F&#252;rstenstuhl erhob.Die K&#246;nigskr&#246;nung Istv&#225;ns im Jahre 1000 durch einen p&#228;pstlichen Gesandten am 17. August 1000 in Esztergom war verbunden mit der Installierung dieser Landeskirche und vermutlich auch mit der Schenkung des K&#246;nigreichs Ungarn an den Papst, der es darauf als Lehen an Istv&#225;n zur&#252;ck gab. Dieser Schritt, analog zur Schaffung des K&#246;nigreichs Polen, sollte die Herrschaft S Istv&#225;ns und die Kontinuit&#228;t der Thronfolge in seiner Familie sichern.Istv&#225;n setzte als K&#246;nig die Christianisierung fort. Er holte vor allem deutsche Ordensleute als Missionare ins Land. Dar&#252;ber hinaus ordnete er die politische Struktur Ungarns neu. Die alten Stammesgebiete ersetzte er durch rund 40 Grafschaften (v&#225;rmegye). Jeder Graf (isp&#225;n) diente nicht nur als Regionalverwalter, sondern auch als Heerf&#252;hrer der freien Krieger, der Jobagionen, seiner Grafschaft.Am 2. September 1031 verungl&#252;ckte Istv&#225;ns einziger Sohn Imre bei einer B&#228;renjagd t&#246;dlich, so dass die Frage der Nachfolge pl&#246;tzlich offen und umstritten war. Istv&#225;n I. ernannte schlie&#223;lich Peter Orseolo, den Sohn seiner Schwester Maria, zu seinem Nachfolger. 1038 verstarb auch Istv&#225;n und wurde neben seinem Sohn in der Marienkirche in Sz&#233;kesfeh&#233;rv&#225;r beigesetzt. Seine Gebeine wurden sp&#228;ter nach Buda &#252;bertragen. Seine bis heute unverweste rechte Hand ist ein nationales Heiligtum. Die Stephanskrone gilt heute, obwohl sie nicht die urspr&#252;ngliche Krone Istv&#225;ns ist, als Zeichen der Einigung und war &#252;ber Jahrhunderte die einzig g&#252;ltige bei der Kr&#246;nung ungarischer K&#246;nige. Sie ist auch Teil des Wappens.1083 wurde Istv&#225;n zusammen mit seinem Sohn heilig gesprochen. Sp&#228;ter sprach ihn auch die orthodoxe Kirche heilig damit ist er der erste Heilige beider Konfessionen seit der Spaltung.</German>

Suo padre, Geza, era un capotrib&#249; magiaro: sua madre era Sarolt (in polacco: Adelajda) della dinastia polacca dei Piasts, e a Stefano fu dato alla nascita il nome di Vajk (che significa "eroe"). Nato pagano nel paese di Esztergom, per essere accettato come futuro re dalla Chiesa di Roma, Vajk fu battezzato all'et&#224; di 10 anni da Sant'Adalberto da Praga, e gli fu dato il nome battesimale di Stefano (in onore dell'omonimo ed originale antico Santo cristiano), protettore della chiesa di Passau.[PARAGRAPH:2]Si spos&#242; nel 995 (secondo alcune fonti la data del matrimonio &#232; diversa) con Gisella di Baviera, la figlia di Enrico II di Baviera il litigioso e di sua moglie Gisella di Burgundia. Stefano e Gisella ebbero almeno due figli maschi: Imre (Emerico od Enrico) ed Ott&#243; (Ottone) ed una femmina: Hedvig (Edvige). Tutti e tre morirono prematuramente e non lasciarono eredi che potessero reclamare il trono dopo la morte di Stefano; a causa di ci&#242; la corona fu quindi oggetto di aspre contese da parte dei suoi nipoti e cugini.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tra il 995 e il 997, Stefano (col nome "Vajk") fu principe di Nitra (una comunit&#224; cristiana slovacca e la capitale della provincia omonima; oggi &#232; una citt&#224; della Slovacchia sudoccidentale) e visse l&#236; assieme alla moglie.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dopo aver combattuto e sconfitto i nobili pagani che gli si erano opposti (incluso suo zio, un potente nobile guerriero di nome Kopp&#225;ny), Stefano divenne Sovrano dei Magiari in Transdanubia nel 997 fino al 1006, periodo in cui si adoper&#242; per unire virtualmente tutti i clan magiari. La vittoria su Kopp&#225;ny fu ottenuta anche grazie alla sostanziale assistenza materiale e militare da parte dei nobili slovacchi cristiani Poznan ed Hunt. In accordo con la tradizione ungherese, all'inizio del Gennaio 1001 Papa Silvestro II invi&#242; a Stefano una magnifica corona d'oro incastonata di gioielli (che divenne il simbolo dell'Ungheria col nome di "Santa Corona") assieme alla Croce Apostolica e ad una lettera di benedizione che lo riconosceva ufficialmente Re Cristiano d'Europa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stefano divise l'Ungheria in 40-50 regioni, continu&#242; il lavoro di suo padre Geza nell'applicare il sistema organizzativo dei suoi antenati detto delle "decime": riorganizz&#242; amministrativamente l'Ungheria in dieci diocesi, ordinando di erigere una chiesa (e di mantenerne il parroco) ogni dieci villagi. Fond&#242; le Cattedrali di Sz&#233;kesfeh&#233;rv&#225;r e di Esztergom, il monastero di Veszpr&#233;m, l'Abbazia benedettina di Pannonhalma, e il Monastero dei Santi Pietro e Paolo ad &#211;buda. All'interno delle abbazie e dei monasteri, furono aperte delle scuole che divennero importanti centri di cultura. Sant'Astrico fu il consigliere di Stefano, che ebbe anche San Gerardo Sagredo come tutore di suo figlio Sant'Emerico (Imre).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stefano scoraggi&#242; le usanze pagane e rafforz&#242; la cristianit&#224; con varie leggi, inclusa la messa al bando del vecchio alfabeto runico unno-magiaro e rendendo il latino la lingua ufficiale della corte regale. Stefano si mostr&#242; sempre generoso nei confronti delle chiese, personalmente le visit&#242; spesso, e supervision&#242; la loro construzione. Quando viaggiava, spesso si travestiva da contadino e liberamente donava delle monete alla povera gente che incontrava (in un caso, Stefano fu aggredito e derubato da un gruppo di briganti a cui aveva fatto elemosina; ma lui se ne dimentic&#242; e risparmi&#242; le loro vite).[PARAGRAPH:2]Stefano era intenzionato a ritirarsi ad una vita di contemplazione spirituale e consegn&#242; il regno al suo unico figlio sopravvissuto, Imre; ma nel 1031 quest'ultimo fu ferito in una battuta di caccia e mor&#236;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stefano pianse a lungo per la perdita del suo figlio favorito Imre, alla cui cura egli aveva dedicato gran parte del suo tempo. Stefano probabilmnte si riprese, ma non manifest&#242; pi&#249; la sua originale vitalit&#224;. Non avendo pi&#249; figli, egli non riusc&#236; a trovare fra i suoi familiari una persona capace di governare il paese con la competenza e la volont&#224; necessarie per sostenere la fede cristiana nella nazione. Incapace di scegliere un erede, Re Stefano mor&#236; a Sz&#233;kesfeh&#233;rv&#225;r nel giorno della Festa dell'Assunzione, e l&#236; fu seppellito; Si dice che la sua corte di nobili e la sua servit&#249; piansero la sua scomparsa per tre anni interi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Immediatamente dopo la sua morte si sparse la voce di miracoli curativi che si verificavano presso la sua tomba. Stefano fu canonizzato dal Vaticano come Santo Stefano d'Ungheria nel 1083. I cattolici lo venerano come il santo patrono d'Ungheria, dei re, dei bambini morti, dei muratori e dei cavatori. La sua ricorrenza cade il 2 settembre, ma in Ungheria la festa principale &#232; osservata il 20 Agosto, il giorno in cui le sue sacre spoglie furono trasferite nella citt&#224; di Buda; questo &#232; un giorno di festa nazionale in Ungheria.[PARAGRAPH:2]La sua corona, conosciuta come la "Santa Corona", attualmente (dal 2000) &#232; conservata nel palazzo del Parlamento Ungherese, a Budapest.</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Frederick Barbarossa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Germany, Italy, Burgundy and Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1122 - June 10, 1190 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Frederick I Barbarossa was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March, crowned King of Italy in Pavia in 1154, and finally crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on 18 June 1155. He was crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. The name Barbarossa came from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule, and means "red beard". Before his royal election, he was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147-1152, as Frederick III). He was the son of Duke Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His mother was Judith, daughter of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf, and Frederick therefore descended from Germany's two leading families, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's prince-electors.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Waiblingen, the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, and the nephew of Conrad III, king of Germany. Conrad III, favouring Frederick over his own son, on his deathbed recommended to the German princes that Frederick be chosen for the German kingship and the imperial throne. Accordingly, after the death of his uncle in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa was made German king and elected Holy Roman emperor (see Holy Roman Empire). He conceived of his imperial title as a grant from God, through the German princes, and wished to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. He consequently decided to consolidate the imperial position in Germany and Italy and began by issuing a general order for peace among the princes of Germany, at the same time granting them extensive concessions. In 1154 he proceeded to Italy, where he received the Lombard crown at Pavia. The following year he was crowned Holy Roman emperor by Pope Adrian IV, whose authority Frederick had reinstated before his coronation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1156 Pope Adrian aroused Frederick against the papacy by implying in a letter to him that the emperor held lands only as a fief from the pope. Two years later Frederick incurred the hostility of the Lombards by demanding recognition of all his royal rights, including his power to appoint the imperial podesta, or governor, in every town. Such cities as Milan, Piacenza, Brescia, and Cremona considered that demand a denial of their communal liberties and in 1158 began a struggle that lasted until 1183 and required Frederick to lead five expeditions to Italy. Between 1158 and 1162 Frederick warred with Milan and its allies, subduing that city and confirming claims to other Italian cities. Meanwhile Frederick had set up a series of antipopes in opposition to the reigning pope, Alexander III, who supported the cause of the Milanese and their allies and who, in 1165, excommunicated Frederick. By attacking the Leonine City in Rome in 1167-1168, Frederick was able to install one of the antipopes, Paschal III, on the papal throne. The Lombard League, consisting of the cities of Milan, Parma, Padua (Padova), Verona, Piacenza, Bologna, Cremona, Mantua (Mantova), Bergamo, and Brescia, was formed in 1167 and eventually acknowledged Pope Alexander as leader. During the next seven years the league acquired military strength, rebuilt Milan, constructed the fortress city of Alessandria, and organized a federal system of administration. The fifth expedition (1174-1176) of Frederick to Italy terminated in defeat by the Lombard League at Legnano. The defeat was significant in military history, because it was the first major triumph of infantry over a mounted army of feudal knights. Frederick was forced in 1177 to acknowledge Alexander III as pope and in 1183 to sign the Peace of Constance, agreeing to the demands of the Lombards for autonomy but retaining imperial authority over the towns.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although imperial control in Italy was virtually ended by his defeat at Legnano, Frederick managed to enhance his prestige in central Europe. He made Poland tributary to the empire, raised Bohemia to the rank of a kingdom, and erected the margravate of Austria into an independent hereditary duchy. His own power as emperor in Germany was firmly established in 1180, when he ended his long struggle with the Welfs by putting down a revolt led by the Welf Henry the Lion and depriving him of most of his lands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick initiated the Third Crusade in 1189, and in the next year, having resigned the government of the empire to his son Henry, later Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, set out for Asia Minor. After gaining two great victories over the Muslims at Philomelion (now Aksehir) and Iconium (now Konya), he has drowned in the Calycadnus (now G&#246;ksu) River in Cilicia (now in Turkey) on June 10, 1190.</English>

		<German>[H1]Friedrich Barbarossa[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Heiliger R&#246;mischer Kaiser[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] ca. 1122 - 10. Juni 1190 n. Chr.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Friedrich I., genannt Barbarossa, aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Staufer war von 1147 bis 1152 als Friedrich III. Herzog von Schwaben, von 1152 bis 1190 r&#246;misch-deutscher K&#246;nig und von 1155 bis 1190 Kaiser des r&#246;misch-deutschen Reiches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit Barbarossas K&#246;nigsherrschaft setzte f&#252;r zwei Jahrzehnte eine intensive F&#246;rderung und Zusammenarbeit mit Heinrich dem L&#246;wen ein. In Norddeutschland konnte der L&#246;we dadurch eine k&#246;nigsgleiche Stellung aufbauen. Die einseitige k&#246;nigliche F&#246;rderung missachtete aber das hocharistokratische Gleichgewicht unterhalb des K&#246;nigtums und machte den L&#246;wen zum St&#246;rfaktor bei den Reichsf&#252;rsten. Barbarossas Herrschaft war gepr&#228;gt vom Doppelkonflikt mit dem lombardischen St&#228;dtebund und dem Papsttum &#252;ber gegenl&#228;ufige Vorstellungen in einer von Rang und Ehre gepr&#228;gten Adelsgesellschaft. Ehrverletzungen und der daraus resultierende Zwang zur Rache waren entscheidend f&#252;r die jahrzehntelangen Konflikte. In den oberitalienischen St&#228;dtekonflikten konnte Barbarossa eine Vermittlerrolle durch den Vorwurf der Parteilichkeit nicht einnehmen. Durch diese strukturellen Zwangssituationen gelang es Barbarossa in Italien aber auch nicht die traditionellen Herrscheraufgaben der Friedens- und Rechtswahrung auszu&#252;ben. Die Verweigerung des kaiserlichen Gerichts missachtete die "Ehre des Reiches" (honor imperii) und f&#252;hrte zur Zerst&#246;rung Tortonas und Mailands. Barbarossa beabsichtigte eine grunds&#228;tzliche Neuordnung der K&#246;nigsherrschaft im Regnum Italicum. Alte Hoheitsrechte des Reiches wurden in Italien wieder beansprucht, neu definiert und schriftlich fixiert. Alle Gerichtshoheit und Amtsgewalt sollten vom Reich ausgehen. Die vom Kaiser eingesetzten Verwalter sowie die r&#252;cksichtslose Ausnutzung der dem Kaiser zugesprochenen Regalien als finanzielle Ressource missachteten aber den gewohnheitsrechtlichen Erwerb von Regalien und Jurisdiktion in den Jahrzehnten vor Barbarossa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Anders als noch in salischer Zeit f&#252;hrte die Exkommunikation des Kaisers nicht zu einer gr&#246;&#223;eren Opposition im n&#246;rdlichen Reichsteil. Erst durch die kaiserliche Niederlage in der Schlacht von Legnano und die Angst Barbarossas um sein Seelenheil wurde 1177 das jahrzehntelange Schisma im Frieden von Venedig und der Konflikt mit den Kommunen im Konstanzer Frieden 1183 beendet. Im Reich wurde Heinrich der L&#246;we durch seine Verweigerung der Hilfeleistung 1176 f&#252;r den Kaiser gegen den Lombardenbund auf Bestreben der F&#252;rsten gest&#252;rzt und musste ins Exil gehen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Beiname "Barbarossa" ("Rotbart") wurde erst im 13. Jahrhundert fester Namensbestandteil. Friedrich Barbarossa entwickelte sich rasch zum Mythos. In der kulturellen Erinnerung der Deutschen des 19. Jahrhunderts verbinden sich mit ihm die Vorstellung von einem H&#246;hepunkt k&#246;niglicher Machtentfaltung und die Sage vom Kaiser, der im Kyffh&#228;user schl&#228;ft und auf bessere Zeiten wartet.</German>

Last of the Piast Dynasty, king of Poland from 1333, the son of Wladyslaw I the Short (Wladyslaw I Lokietek).[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir is the only Polish king who did receive and maintain the title of the great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry was once also called the great, but not today), and the title is well deserved. When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him "king of Krakow. The economy was ruined, and country was depopulated and tired with wars. At the time of his death, it had doubled in land area (mostly through joining lands in today's Ukraine, then Duchy of Halicz), grew prosperous, wealthy and had great prospects to the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was preparing other ones just before he died.[PARAGRAPH:2]He built many new castles, reformed the Polish army, as well as Polish civil and criminal laws. At the Sejm in Wislica, March 11, 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Little Poland, which gained for him the title of "the Polish Justinian". He founded the University of Krakow although his death stalled the development of the university (and that's why today it is called Jagiellonian instead of Casimirian).He organised a meeting of kings in Krakow in 1364 which showed the wealth of Polish kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir was sonless. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable to inherit or too young. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession instead of problems of uncertainty, he arranged his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis, King of Hungary to be his successors in Poland. Louis was proclaimed polish king in Casimir's death in 1370, but Elisabeth held much of the practical power until her death in 1380.</English>

Upon his father's death, he formally came to the throne at the age of three, but his minority was dominated by regents. Initially his mother Elena Glinskaya acted as regent, but she died when Ivan was only eight. She was replaced as regent by boyars from the Shuisky family until Ivan assumed power in 1544. According to his own letters, Ivan customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. These traumatic experiences may have contributed to his hatred of the boyars and to his mental instability. He was known to throw cats and dogs out of the Kremlin windows, among other cruel acts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan was crowned king with Monomakh's Cap at the Cathedral of the Dormition at age sixteen on January 16, 1547. Despite calamities triggered by the Great Fire of 1547, the early part of his reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code (known as the sudebnik), created a standing army (the streltsy), established the first Russian parliament of the feudal estates (the Zemsky Sobor), the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council), and confirmed the position of the Church with the Council of the Hundred Chapters, which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the entire country. He introduced the local self-management in rural regions, mainly in the Northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry. During his reign the first printing press was introduced to Russia (although the first Russian printers Ivan Fedorov and Pyotr Mstislavets had to flee from Moscow to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania).[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan formed new trading connections, opening up the White Sea and the port of Arkhangelsk to the Muscovy Company of English merchants. In 1552 he defeated the Kazan Khanate, whose armies had repeatedly devastated the Northeast of Russia, and annexed its territory. In 1556, he annexed the Astrakhan Khanate and destroyed the largest slave market on the river Volga. These conquests complicated the migration of the aggressive nomadic hordes from Asia to Europe through Volga and transformed Russia into a multinational and multiconfessional state. He had St. Basil's Cathedral constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of Kazan. Legend has it that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architects blinded, so that they could never design anything as beautiful again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other less positive aspects of this period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the peasants, which would eventually lead to serfdom. The dramatic change in Ivan's personality is traditionally linked to his near-fatal illness in 1553 and the death of his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna in 1560. Ivan suspected boyars of poisoning his wife and of plotting to replace him on the throne with his cousin, Vladimir of Staritsa. In addition, during that illness Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the tsar's health too hopeless to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and murders of innocent people, including Metropolitan Philip and Prince Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky.[PARAGRAPH:2]Also problematic was the 1565 formation of the Oprichnina. The Oprichnina was the section of Russia (mainly the Northeast) directly ruled by Ivan and policed by his personal servicemen, the Oprichniki. This whole system of Oprichnina has been viewed by some historians as a tool against the omnipotent hereditary nobility of Russia (boyars) who opposed the absolutist drive of the tsar, while others have interpreted it as a sign of the paranoia and mental deterioration of the tsar.[PARAGRAPH:2]The later half of Ivan's reign was far less successful. Although Khan Devlet I Giray of Crimea repeatedly devastated Moscow region and even set Moscow on fire in 1571, the tsar supported Yermak's conquest of Tatar Siberia, adopting a policy of empire-building, which led him to launch a victorious war of seaward expansion to the west, only to find himself fighting the Swedes, Lithuanians, Poles, and the Livonian Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]For twenty-four years the Livonian War dragged on, damaging the Russian economy and military and failing to gain any territory for Russia. In the 1560s the combination of drought and famine, Polish-Lithuanian raids, Tatar invasions, and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the Hanseatic League devastated Russia. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten. Epidemics of the plague killed 10,000 in Novgorod. In 1570 the plague killed 600-1000 in Moscow daily. Ivan's closest advisor, Prince Andrei Kurbsky, defected to the Lithuanians, headed the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of Velikiye Luki. This treachery deeply hurt Ivan. As the Oprichnina continued, Ivan became mentally unstable and physically disabled. In one week, he could easily pass from the most depraved orgies to prayers and fasting in a remote northern monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because he gradually grew unbalanced and violent, the Oprichniks under Malyuta Skuratov soon got out of hand and became murderous thugs. They massacred nobles and peasants, and conscripted men to fight the war in Livonia. Depopulation and famine ensued. What had been by far the richest area of Russia became the poorest. In a dispute with the wealthy city of Novgorod, Ivan ordered the Oprichniks to murder inhabitants of this city, which was never to regain its former prosperity. Between thirty and forty thousand might have been killed during the infamous Massacre of Novgorod in 1570; many others were deported elsewhere. Yet the official death toll named 1,500 of Novgorod big people (nobility) and only mentioned about the same number of smaller people. Many modern researchers estimate number of victims between two and three thousand. (After the famine and epidemics of 1560s the population of Novgorod did not exceed 10,000-20,000.)[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law for wearing immodest clothing, causing a miscarriage. His son, also named Ivan, upon learning of this, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff, causing his son's (accidental) death. This event is depicted in the famous painting by Ilya Repin, Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, November 16, 1581 better known as Ivan the Terrible killing his son.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although it is thought by many that Ivan died while setting up a chess board, it is more likely that he died while playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on March 18, 1584. When Ivan's tomb was opened during renovations in the 1960s, his remains were examined and discovered to contain very high amounts of mercury, indicating a high probability that he was poisoned. Modern suspicion falls on his advisors Belsky and Boris Godunov (who became tsar in 1598). Three days earlier, Ivan had allegedly attempted to rape Irina, Godunov's sister and Feodor's wife. Her cries attracted Godunov and Belsky to the noise, whereupon Ivan let Irina go, but Belsky and Godunov considered themselves marked for death. The tradition says that they either poisoned or strangled Ivan in fear for their own lives. The mercury found in Ivan's remains may also be related to treatment for syphilis, which it is speculated that Ivan had. Upon Ivan's death, the ravaged kingdom was left to his unfit and childless son Feodor.</English>

		<Portuguese>[H1]Ivan "the Terrible" IV[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]First Tsar of Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] August 25, 1530 - March 18, 1584 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ivan IV was the Grand Duke of Muscovy from 1533 to 1547 and was the first ruler of Russia to assume the title of tsar. His long reign saw the conquest of Kazan Khanate and Siberia and subsequent transformation of Russia into a multiethnic and multiconfessional state. This tsar retains his place in the Russian tradition simply as Ivan Grozny, which is traditionally translated into English as Ivan the Terrible.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan (or Ioann, as his name is rendered in Church Slavonic) was a long-awaited son of Vasili III. Upon his father's death, he formally came to the throne at the age of three, but his minority was dominated by regents. Initially his mother Elena Glinskaya acted as regent, but she died when Ivan was only eight. She was replaced as regent by boyars from the Shuisky family until Ivan assumed power in 1544. According to his own letters, Ivan customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families. These traumatic experiences may have contributed to his hatred of the boyars and to his mental instability. He was known to throw cats and dogs out of the Kremlin windows, among other cruel acts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan was crowned king with Monomakh's Cap at the Cathedral of the Dormition at age sixteen on January 16, 1547. Despite calamities triggered by the Great Fire of 1547, the early part of his reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code (known as the sudebnik), created a standing army (the streltsy), established the first Russian parliament of the feudal estates (the Zemsky Sobor), the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council), and confirmed the position of the Church with the Council of the Hundred Chapters, which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the entire country. He introduced the local self-management in rural regions, mainly in the Northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry. During his reign the first printing press was introduced to Russia (although the first Russian printers Ivan Fedorov and Pyotr Mstislavets had to flee from Moscow to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania).[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan formed new trading connections, opening up the White Sea and the port of Arkhangelsk to the Muscovy Company of English merchants. In 1552 he defeated the Kazan Khanate, whose armies had repeatedly devastated the Northeast of Russia, and annexed its territory. In 1556, he annexed the Astrakhan Khanate and destroyed the largest slave market on the river Volga. These conquests complicated the migration of the aggressive nomadic hordes from Asia to Europe through Volga and transformed Russia into a multinational and multiconfessional state. He had St. Basil's Cathedral constructed in Moscow to commemorate the seizure of Kazan. Legend has it that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architects blinded, so that they could never design anything as beautiful again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Other less positive aspects of this period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the peasants, which would eventually lead to serfdom. The dramatic change in Ivan's personality is traditionally linked to his near-fatal illness in 1553 and the death of his first wife, Anastasia Romanovna in 1560. Ivan suspected boyars of poisoning his wife and of plotting to replace him on the throne with his cousin, Vladimir of Staritsa. In addition, during that illness Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the tsar's health too hopeless to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and murders of innocent people, including Metropolitan Philip and Prince Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky.[PARAGRAPH:2]Also problematic was the 1565 formation of the Oprichnina. The Oprichnina was the section of Russia (mainly the Northeast) directly ruled by Ivan and policed by his personal servicemen, the Oprichniki. This whole system of Oprichnina has been viewed by some historians as a tool against the omnipotent hereditary nobility of Russia (boyars) who opposed the absolutist drive of the tsar, while others have interpreted it as a sign of the paranoia and mental deterioration of the tsar.[PARAGRAPH:2]The later half of Ivan's reign was far less successful. Although Khan Devlet I Giray of Crimea repeatedly devastated Moscow region and even set Moscow on fire in 1571, the tsar supported Yermak's conquest of Tatar Siberia, adopting a policy of empire-building, which led him to launch a victorious war of seaward expansion to the west, only to find himself fighting the Swedes, Lithuanians, Poles, and the Livonian Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]For twenty-four years the Livonian War dragged on, damaging the Russian economy and military and failing to gain any territory for Russia. In the 1560s the combination of drought and famine, Polish-Lithuanian raids, Tatar invasions, and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the Hanseatic League devastated Russia. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten. Epidemics of the plague killed 10,000 in Novgorod. In 1570 the plague killed 600-1000 in Moscow daily. Ivan's closest advisor, Prince Andrei Kurbsky, defected to the Lithuanians, headed the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of Velikiye Luki. This treachery deeply hurt Ivan. As the Oprichnina continued, Ivan became mentally unstable and physically disabled. In one week, he could easily pass from the most depraved orgies to prayers and fasting in a remote northern monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]Because he gradually grew unbalanced and violent, the Oprichniks under Malyuta Skuratov soon got out of hand and became murderous thugs. They massacred nobles and peasants, and conscripted men to fight the war in Livonia. Depopulation and famine ensued. What had been by far the richest area of Russia became the poorest. In a dispute with the wealthy city of Novgorod, Ivan ordered the Oprichniks to murder inhabitants of this city, which was never to regain its former prosperity. Between thirty and forty thousand might have been killed during the infamous Massacre of Novgorod in 1570; many others were deported elsewhere. Yet the official death toll named 1,500 of Novgorod big people (nobility) and only mentioned about the same number of smaller people. Many modern researchers estimate number of victims between two and three thousand. (After the famine and epidemics of 1560s the population of Novgorod did not exceed 10,000-20,000.)[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law for wearing immodest clothing, causing a miscarriage. His son, also named Ivan, upon learning of this, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff, causing his son's (accidental) death. This event is depicted in the famous painting by Ilya Repin, Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, November 16, 1581 better known as Ivan the Terrible killing his son.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although it is thought by many that Ivan died while setting up a chess board, it is more likely that he died while playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on March 18, 1584. When Ivan's tomb was opened during renovations in the 1960s, his remains were examined and discovered to contain very high amounts of mercury, indicating a high probability that he was poisoned. Modern suspicion falls on his advisors Belsky and Boris Godunov (who became tsar in 1598). Three days earlier, Ivan had allegedly attempted to rape Irina, Godunov's sister and Feodor's wife. Her cries attracted Godunov and Belsky to the noise, whereupon Ivan let Irina go, but Belsky and Godunov considered themselves marked for death. The tradition says that they either poisoned or strangled Ivan in fear for their own lives. The mercury found in Ivan's remains may also be related to treatment for syphilis, which it is speculated that Ivan had.

(The first conspirator's head rolled on December 20, 1339) This led to the establishment of a bodyguard of 103 mounted soldiers.

He fought several successful campaigns against the Moors and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Leon-Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the archbishop of Braga, to confirm the independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own.

In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula.

He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated.

		<English>[H1]Maximilian I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] March 22, 1459 - January 12, 1519 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maximilian I, Holy Roman emperor, son of the emperor Frederick III and Leonora, daughter of Edward, King of Portugal, was born at Vienna Neustadt on the 22nd of March 1459. On the 18th of August 1477, by his marriage at Ghent to Mary, who had just inherited Burgundy and the Netherlands from her father Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, he effected a union of great importance in the history of the house of Habsburg. He at once undertook the defense of his wife's dominions from an attack by Louis XI, king of France, and defeated the French forces at Guinegatte, the modern Enguinegatte, on the 7th of August 1479. But Maximilian was regarded with suspicion by the states of Netherlands, and after suppressing a rising in Gelderland his position was further weakened by the death of his wife on the 27th of March 1482. He claimed to be recognized as guardian of his young son Philip and as regent of the Netherlands, but some of the states refused to agree to his demands and disorder was general. Maximilian was compelled to assent to the treaty of Arras in 1482 between the states of the Netherlands and Louis XI. This treaty provided that Maximilian's daughter Margaret of Austria should marry Charles, the dauphin of France, and have for her dowry Artois and Franche-Comt&#233;, two of the provinces in dispute, while the claim of Louis on the Duchy of Burgundy was tacitly admitted. Maximilian did not, however, abandon the struggle in the Netherlands. Having crushed a rebellion at Utrecht, he compelled the burghers of Ghent to restore Philip to him in 1485, and returning to Germany was chosen king of the Romans, or German king, at Frankfurt on the 16th of February 1486, and crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 9th of the following April. Again in the Netherlands, he made a treaty with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, whose independence was threatened by the French regent, Anne of Beaujeu, and the struggle with France was soon renewed. This war was very unpopular with the trading cities of the Netherlands, and early in 1488 Maximilian, having entered Bruges, was detained there as a prisoner for nearly three months, and only set at liberty on the approach of his father with a large force. On his release he had promised he would maintain the treaty of Arras and withdraw from the Netherlands; but he delayed his departure for nearly a year and took part in a punitive campaign against his captors and their allies. On his return to Germany he made peace with France at Frankfurt in July 1489, and in October several of the states of the Netherlands recognized him as their ruler and as guardian of his son. In March 1490 the county of Tirol was added to his possessions through the abdication of his kinsman, Count Sigismund, and this district soon became his favorite residence.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 1493 the death of the emperor left Maximilian sole ruler of Germany and head of the house of Habsburg; and on the 16th of March 1494 he married at Innsbruck Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan (d. 1476). At this time Bianca's uncle, Ludovico Sforza, was invested with the Duchy of Milan in return for the substantial dowry which his niece brought to the king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maximilian harbored the idea of driving the Turks from Europe; but his appeal to all Christian sovereigns was ineffectual. In 1494 he was again in the Netherlands, where he led an expedition against the rebels of Gelderland, assisted Perkin Warbeck to make a descent upon England, and formally handed over the government of the Low Countries to Philip. His attention was next turned to Italy, and, alarmed at the progress of Charles VIII in the peninsula, he signed the league of Venice in March 1495, and about the same time arranged a marriage between his son Philip and Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, king and queen of Castile and Aragon. The need for help to prosecute the war in Italy caused the king to call the diet to Worms in March 1495, when he urged the necessity of checking the progress of Charles. As during his father's lifetime Maximilian had favored the reforming party among the princes, proposals for the better government of the empire were brought forward at Worms as a necessary preliminary to financial and military support. Some reforms were adopted, the public peace was proclaimed without any limitation of time and a general tax was levied.[PARAGRAPH:2]The three succeeding years were mainly occupied with quarrels with the diet, with two invasions of France, and a war in Gelderland against Charles, count of Egmont, who claimed that duchy, and was supported by French troops. The reforms of 1495 were rendered abortive by the refusal of Maximilian to attend the diets or to take any part in the working of the new constitution, and in 1497 he strengthened his own authority by establishing an Aulic Council (Reichshofrath), which he declared was competent to deal with all business of the empire, and about the same time set up a court to centralize the financial administration of Germany.[PARAGRAPH:2]In February 1499 the king became involved in a war with the Swiss, who had refused to pay the imperial taxes or to furnish a contribution for the Italian expedition. Aided by France they defeated the German troops, and the peace of Basel in September 1499 recognized them as virtually independent of the empire. About this time Maximilian's ally, Ludovico of Milan, was taken prisoner by Louis XII, King of France, and Maximilian was again compelled to ask the diet for help. An elaborate scheme for raising an army was agreed to, and in return a council of regency (Reichsregiment) was established, which amounted, in the words of a Venetian envoy, to a deposition of the king. The relations were now very strained between the reforming princes and Maximilian, who, unable to raise an army, refused to attend the meetings of the council at Nuremberg, while both parties treated for peace with France. The hostility of the king rendered the council impotent. He was successful in winning the support of many of the younger princes, and in establishing a new court of justice, the members of which were named by himself. The negotiations with France ended in the treaty of Blois, signed in September 1504, when Maximilian's grandson Charles was betrothed to Claude, daughter of Louis XII, and Louis, invested with the Duchy of Milan, agreed to aid the king of the Romans to secure the imperial crown. A succession difficulty in Bavaria-Landshut was only decided after Maximilian had taken up arms and narrowly escaped with his life at Regensburg. In the settlement of this question, made in 1505, he secured a considerable increase of territory, and when the king met the diet at Cologne in 1505 he was at the height of his power. His enemies at home were crushed, and their leader, Berthold, elector of Mainz, was dead; while the outlook abroad was more favorable than it had been since his accession.</English>

Jedoch verstand sich Maximilian nicht nur auf allerlei sportliche Aktivit&#228;ten, sondern er war auch in der Kunst der Strategie und Taktik im Kriegswesen bestens ausgebildet worden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Alter von achtzehn Jahren wurde Maximilian am 19. August 1477 in Gent mit der Tochter Karls "des K&#252;hnen", Maria von Burgund, verheiratet. Diese Ehe entstand, wie so viele in der Geschichte Habsburgs, aus einer politischen &#220;berlegung heraus. Um sich politisch zu festigen, w&#252;nschte Maximilians Vater Friedrich III. diese Heirat. Allerdings verlief diese Ehe dann nicht mit der politischen Berechenbarkeit, durch welche sie entstanden war, sondern eine echte Liebe entstand zwischen Maria und Maximilian. Dieser Liebe entsprang etwa ein Jahr nach der Eheschlie&#223;ung das erste Kind. Dieser Junge bekam den Namen Philipp, der bald um den Namensanhang "der Sch&#246;ne" erweitert wurde.[NEWLINE]Das Leben in Gent war f&#252;r Maximilian aber nicht immer einfach. Der Franzosenk&#246;nig Ludwig XI. wollte Maximilian, der damals schon deutscher K&#246;nig war, das Gebiet Burgund streitig machen. Ludwig XI. lie&#223; nichts unversucht, um seiner Forderung nach dem Territorium Nachdruck zu verleihen. Maximilian hingegen, der ja auch in die Kriegskunst und die Lehre der Taktik eingeschult war, baute das etwas marode burgundische Heer aus und bringt 1478 die Schweizer dazu, aus einer zuvor eingegangenen Allianz mit Frankreich auszutreten. In darauf folgenden Schlachten f&#252;gte Maximilians neue Streitmacht den Franzosen immer wieder kleinere Niederlagen zu. Jedoch war der Habsburg noch nicht erfahren genug, um zu realisieren, dass Ludwig XI. schon l&#228;ngst auf politischer Ebene gegen ihn vorging.[NEWLINE]Um die Streitigkeiten zu beenden und auch die politische St&#228;rke zu untermauern, musste Maximilian in einer f&#252;r ihn schwierigen Zeit seine erst dreij&#228;hrige Tochter Margarete zur Verlobung mit dem Sohn des Franzosenk&#246;nigs, Karl VIII., freigeben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als 1482 Maximilians erneut schwangere Frau, Maria von Burgund, bei einem Jagdausflug vom Pferd f&#228;llt und ihren Verletzungen im Alter von 25 Jahren nach wenigen Wochen erliegt, schl&#228;gt ihm bald eine Welle der Ablehnung der Burgunder entgegen. Sie wollen nur den Sohn und Thronerben behalten, ihn selbst jedoch wollen sie nicht mehr in ihrer Mitte haben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ende August 1483 stirbt der Franzose Ludwig XI. und sein Sohn Karl VIII. besteigt den Thron. Karl l&#228;sst den ungeliebten Schwiegervater in Br&#252;gge gefangen nehmen. Erst als Maximilians Vater Friedrich III. mit einem Milit&#228;rschlag droht, l&#228;sst Karl den Habsburger frei.[PARAGRAPH:2]Um seinen Einfluss zu erweitern heiratet Maximilian Anna von der Bretagne, daraufhin r&#252;ckt Karl VIII. mit seinem Heer in der Bretagne ein und l&#228;sst durch ein p&#228;pstliches Dispens die Ehe zwischen dem Habsburg und Anna annullieren. F&#252;r Karl aber noch nicht genug, er heiratet selbst die Erbprinzessin Anna von der Bretagne. Allerdings kommt er jetzt in den Konflikt, dass ihm ja schon die Tochter von Maximilian vertraglich zugesichert war. Allerdings braucht sich Karl VIII. um diese Frage nicht weiter zu k&#252;mmern, denn Maximilian greift nun seinerseits den Franzosen an und erobert einen Gro&#223;teil seiner Erblande zur&#252;ck. Burgund jedoch bleibt in franz&#246;sischer Hand. Der deutsche K&#246;nig ist inzwischen aber kriegsm&#252;de geworden und so kehrt er nach &#214;sterreich zur&#252;ck.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Erzherzog Sigmund in den L&#228;ndereien Tirols eine herbe, wirtschaftliche Niederlage erleidet, muss er zu Gunsten von Maximilian I. abdanken und die Regierungsgesch&#228;fte an ihn &#252;bergeben.[PARAGRAPH:2]1493 heiratet der Habsburg nun zum dritten mal. Bianca Maria Sforza hie&#223; die Auserw&#228;hlte und entstammte der m&#228;chtigsten Familie Mailands. Maximilian, dessen Kassen eigentlich immer leer waren brauchte diese Ehe als finanzielle Absicherung und auf Grund der strategischen Wichtigkeit Mailands. Das Herzogtum hatte eine Schl&#252;sselposition im Ringen um Italien. Streitparteien waren auch hier wieder Maximilian und der Franzosenk&#246;nig Karl VIII.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im August des selben Jahres stirbt nun Maximilians Vater Friedrich III. im Alter von knapp 78 Jahren. Der deutsche K&#246;nig befasst sich nun intensiver mit der politischen Situation. Sein Vater Friedrich III. hatte ihn bis dahin aus den Regierungsgesch&#228;ften immer ein wenig herausgehalten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maximilians Sohn, Philipp "der Sch&#246;ne" wird am 20. Oktober 1496 in Lier mit Juana (Johanna) von Kastilien verheiratet. Somit ist der Aufstieg des Hauses Habsburg zur Weltgeltung besiegelt. Maximilian selbst versucht sich weiterhin den politischen Gesch&#228;ften zu widmen, die Streitigkeiten langweilen ihn aber immer mehr und so zieht er es vor sich in den Tiroler Bergen den Jagdfreuden zu widmen. Jedoch lie&#223; er die Politik nicht g&#228;nzlich Ruhen. Als der Habsburger im Januar 1519 auf dem Weg nach Wien in Wels stirbt, besteigt sein Enkel Karl V. den Kaiserthron.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Maximilian I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Holy Roman Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] March 22, 1459 - January 12, 1519 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Maximilian I, Holy Roman emperor, son of the emperor Frederick III and Leonora, daughter of Edward, King of Portugal, was born at Vienna Neustadt on the 22nd of March 1459. On the 18th of August 1477, by his marriage at Ghent to Mary, who had just inherited Burgundy and the Netherlands from her father Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, he effected a union of great importance in the history of the house of Habsburg. He at once undertook the defense of his wife's dominions from an attack by Louis XI, king of France, and defeated the French forces at Guinegatte, the modern Enguinegatte, on the 7th of August 1479. But Maximilian was regarded with suspicion by the states of Netherlands, and after suppressing a rising in Gelderland his position was further weakened by the death of his wife on the 27th of March 1482. He claimed to be recognized as guardian of his young son Philip and as regent of the Netherlands, but some of the states refused to agree to his demands and disorder was general. Maximilian was compelled to assent to the treaty of Arras in 1482 between the states of the Netherlands and Louis XI. This treaty provided that Maximilian's daughter Margaret of Austria should marry Charles, the dauphin of France, and have for her dowry Artois and Franche-Comt&#233;, two of the provinces in dispute, while the claim of Louis on the Duchy of Burgundy was tacitly admitted. Maximilian did not, however, abandon the struggle in the Netherlands. Having crushed a rebellion at Utrecht, he compelled the burghers of Ghent to restore Philip to him in 1485, and returning to Germany was chosen king of the Romans, or German king, at Frankfurt on the 16th of February 1486, and crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 9th of the following April. Again in the Netherlands, he made a treaty with Francis II, Duke of Brittany, whose independence was threatened by the French regent, Anne of Beaujeu, and the struggle with France was soon renewed. This war was very unpopular with the trading cities of the Netherlands, and early in 1488 Maximilian, having entered Bruges, was detained there as a prisoner for nearly three months, and only set at liberty on the approach of his father with a large force. On his release he had promised he would maintain the treaty of Arras and withdraw from the Netherlands; but he delayed his departure for nearly a year and took part in a punitive campaign against his captors and their allies. On his return to Germany he made peace with France at Frankfurt in July 1489, and in October several of the states of the Netherlands recognized him as their ruler and as guardian of his son. In March 1490 the county of Tirol was added to his possessions through the abdication of his kinsman, Count Sigismund, and this district soon became his favorite residence.[PARAGRAPH:2]In August 1493 the death of the emperor left Maximilian sole ruler of Germany and head of the house of Habsburg; and on the 16th of March 1494 he married at Innsbruck Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan (d. 1476). At this time Bianca's uncle, Ludovico Sforza, was invested with the Duchy of Milan in return for the substantial dowry which his niece brought to the king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maximilian harbored the idea of driving the Turks from Europe; but his appeal to all Christian sovereigns was ineffectual. In 1494 he was again in the Netherlands, where he led an expedition against the rebels of Gelderland, assisted Perkin Warbeck to make a descent upon England, and formally handed over the government of the Low Countries to Philip. His attention was next turned to Italy, and, alarmed at the progress of Charles VIII in the peninsula, he signed the league of Venice in March 1495, and about the same time arranged a marriage between his son Philip and Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, king and queen of Castile and Aragon. The need for help to prosecute the war in Italy caused the king to call the diet to Worms in March 1495, when he urged the necessity of checking the progress of Charles. As during his father's lifetime Maximilian had favored the reforming party among the princes, proposals for the better government of the empire were brought forward at Worms as a necessary preliminary to financial and military support. Some reforms were adopted, the public peace was proclaimed without any limitation of time and a general tax was levied.[PARAGRAPH:2]The three succeeding years were mainly occupied with quarrels with the diet, with two invasions of France, and a war in Gelderland against Charles, count of Egmont, who claimed that duchy, and was supported by French troops. The reforms of 1495 were rendered abortive by the refusal of Maximilian to attend the diets or to take any part in the working of the new constitution, and in 1497 he strengthened his own authority by establishing an Aulic Council (Reichshofrath), which he declared was competent to deal with all business of the empire, and about the same time set up a court to centralize the financial administration of Germany.[PARAGRAPH:2]In February 1499 the king became involved in a war with the Swiss, who had refused to pay the imperial taxes or to furnish a contribution for the Italian expedition. Aided by France they defeated the German troops, and the peace of Basel in September 1499 recognized them as virtually independent of the empire. About this time Maximilian's ally, Ludovico of Milan, was taken prisoner by Louis XII, King of France, and Maximilian was again compelled to ask the diet for help. An elaborate scheme for raising an army was agreed to, and in return a council of regency (Reichsregiment) was established, which amounted, in the words of a Venetian envoy, to a deposition of the king. The relations were now very strained between the reforming princes and Maximilian, who, unable to raise an army, refused to attend the meetings of the council at Nuremberg, while both parties treated for peace with France. The hostility of the king rendered the council impotent. He was successful in winning the support of many of the younger princes, and in establishing a new court of justice, the members of which were named by himself. The negotiations with France ended in the treaty of Blois, signed in September 1504, when Maximilian's grandson Charles was betrothed to Claude, daughter of Louis XII, and Louis, invested with the Duchy of Milan, agreed to aid the king of the Romans to secure the imperial crown. A succession difficulty in Bavaria-Landshut was only decided after Maximilian had taken up arms and narrowly escaped with his life at Regensburg. In the settlement of this question, made in 1505, he secured a considerable increase of territory, and when the king met the diet at Cologne in 1505 he was at the height of his power. His enemies at home were crushed, and their leader, Berthold, elector of Mainz, was dead; while the outlook abroad was more favorable than it had been since his accession.</Italian>

He was the first monarch of the House of Vasa, an influential noble family which came to be the royal house of Sweden for much of the 16th and 17th centuries. Gustav I was elected regent in 1521 after leading a rebellion against Christian II of Denmark, the leader of the Kalmar Union who controlled most of Sweden at the time.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was an enigmatic person who has been referred to as both a liberator of the country and as a tyrannical ruler, which has made him the subject of many books. When he came to power in 1523, he was largely unknown, and he became the ruler of a still divided country without a central government. Though not as famous as most of his continental contemporaries, he became the first truly autocratic native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled propagandist and bureaucrat who laid the foundations for a more efficient centralized government. During his reign Protestantism was introduced in the country. In traditional Swedish history he has been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the "father of the nation". Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temperament, but he also loved music, and had a certain sly wit.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was born in Lindholmen, Sweden to a noble family, and was educated at the University of Uppsala. As a young man he entered the army, and from 1518 to 1519 he fought against Christian II, king of Denmark, who had invaded Sweden to regain the throne that the Danes had lost in 1501. Gustav was taken hostage but managed to escape. He was still a fugitive when he heard that Christian had massacred his father and other nationalist Swedish nobles in the Stockholm bloodbath of 1520. From 1521 to 1523, with an army of peasants, Gustav led a successful revolt and drove the Danes out of Sweden. His victory resulted in the dissolution of the Union of Kalmar, which in 1397 had placed Sweden and Norway under the Danish crown. Gustav was administrator of the kingdom from 1521 to 1523, when the Riksdag, or national assembly, elected him king. He strengthened his political hold and restored order by introducing the Reformation into Sweden. The Roman Catholic church had supported Christian II, and Gustav used this as an excuse for stripping the church of political power and confiscating its property. In 1527 he made Swedish bishops subject to royal power, and in 1529 he proclaimed Lutheranism the state religion. He joined with Norway in 1537 to defeat the German city of L&#220;beck, making Sweden economically independent of the Hanseatic League, a federation of German cities to enhance their commercial interests. Gustav created a strongly united state by introducing a sound financial administration, strengthening manufacturing, trade, and agricultural interests, and increasing the military forces. In 1544 he made the Swedish crown hereditary through his line, the house of Vasa. On his death, Gustav was succeeded by his son, Eric XIV.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav's heritage has been disputed. In 19th century Swedish history a folklore developed wherein Gustav was supposed to have had all kinds of adventures when he liberated Sweden from the Danes. The memory of Gustav has been honored greatly, resulting in embroidered history books, commemorative coins, and the annual ski event Vasaloppet (the largest ski event in the world with 15,000 participants). The city of Vaasa in Finland was named after the royal house of Vasa in 1606. Gustav is currently portrayed on the 1000 kronor note. Today most of these stories are considered to have no other foundation than legend and skilful propaganda by Gustav himself during his time. Gustav has been regarded by some as a power-hungry man who wished to control everything: the Church, the economy, the army and all foreign affairs. But in doing this, he also did manage to unite Sweden, a country that previously had no standardized language, and where individual provinces held a strong regional power. He also laid the foundation for Sweden's professional army that was to make Sweden into a regional superpower in the 17th century.</English>

Da von den Byzantinern keine ad&#228;quate Hilfe zu erwarten war, mussten sich die Bisch&#246;fe anderweitig um Hilfe bem&#252;hen.

Als Gegenleistung f&#252;r die kirchliche Unterst&#252;tzung seiner Eroberungen, fiel Pippin in Italien ein und vertrieb die Langobarden, die bereits vor den Toren Roms standen.

		<English>[H1]George III[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Great Britain, King of Ireland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 4, 1738 - January 29, 1820 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]George III was born in 1738, first son of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Augusta. He married Charlotte of Mecklinburg-Strelitz in 1761, to whom he was devoted. The couple produced a prolific fifteen children: nine sons and six daughters. George was afflicted with porphyria, a maddening disease which disrupted his reign as early as 1765. Several attacks strained his grip on reality and debilitated him in the last years of his reign. Personal rule was given to his son George, the Prince Regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf and mad at Windsor Castle on January 29, 1820.[PARAGRAPH:2]George III succeeded his grandfather, George II, in 1760 (Frederick, Prince of Wales, had died in 1751 having never ruled). George was determined to recover the prerogative lost to the ministerial council by the first two Georges; in the first two decades of the reign, he methodically weakened the Whig party through bribery, coercion and patronage. Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder was toppled by Whigs after the Peace of Paris, and men of mediocre talent and servile minds were hand-picked by George as Cabinet members, acting as little more than yes-men. Bouts with madness and the way he handled the American Revolution eroded his support and the power of the Crown was granted again to the Prime Minister.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Peace of Paris (1763) ended the Seven Years' War with France, with the strenuous, anti-French policies of the elder Pitt emphasizing naval superiority in the colonial warfare. Great Britain emerged from the conflict as the world's greatest colonial power. England thrived under peacetime conditions, but George's commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed independence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Peace of Versailles, signed in 1783, ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America. The defeat cost George dearly: his sanity was stretched to the breaking point and his political power decreased when William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister in 1783. George reclaimed some of his power, driving Pitt from office from 1801-04, but his condition worsened again and he ceased to rule in 1811.[PARAGRAPH:2]The peace following the French war settlement was short-lived. A mere ten years later, England joined a continental alliance against French revolutionary forces who, after gaining power in France, sought total French hegemony across Europe. By 1797, the largest part of Europe was under French dominance, with England standing alone against the revolutionary Republic. The British Navy again proved decisive, defeating French forces at Camperdown, Cape St. Vincent and the Battle of the Nile in 1797, and finally at Copenhagen in 1801. Peace was negotiated at Amiens in 1802, with the French supreme on land and the British at sea. Napoleon Bonaparte seized supreme power in France at the turn of the century, and renewed attacks against England in 1803. Hostilities with France lasted until 1814 taking several forms.

George was afflicted with porphyria, a maddening disease which disrupted his reign as early as 1765. Several attacks strained his grip on reality and debilitated him in the last years of his reign.

The colonists proclaimed independence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Peace of Versailles, signed in 1783, ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America. The defeat cost George dearly: his sanity was stretched to the breaking point and his political power decreased when William Pitt the Younger became Prime Minister in 1783. George reclaimed some of his power, driving Pitt from office from 1801-04, but his condition worsened again and he ceased to rule in 1811.[PARAGRAPH:2]The peace following the French war settlement was short-lived.

By 1797, the largest part of Europe was under French dominance, with England standing alone against the revolutionary Republic. The British Navy again proved decisive, defeating French forces at Camperdown, Cape St. Vincent and the Battle of the Nile in 1797, and finally at Copenhagen in 1801.

Wilhelm Friedrich (englisch George William Frederick) war von 1760 bis 1801 K&#246;nig von Gro&#223;britannien und Irland, danach bis zu seinem Tod K&#246;nig des Vereinigten K&#246;nigreichs von Gro&#223;britannien und Irland. Im Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reich Deutscher Nation regierte er als Kurf&#252;rst von Braunschweig-L&#252;neburg, seit dem Wiener Kongress als K&#246;nig von Hannover (1814). Er f&#252;hrte den nominellen Titel eines Herzogs von Braunschweig-L&#252;neburg. Au&#223;erdem war er der letzte britische Monarch, welcher sich in Folge des Hundertj&#228;hrigen Krieges als K&#246;nig von Frankreich bezeichnete.[PARAGRAPH:2]Georg war der dritte britische Monarch aus dem Haus Hannover, doch der erste, der in Gro&#223;britannien geboren wurde und dessen Muttersprache Englisch war. In seine au&#223;erordentlich lange Herrschaftszeit fallen der Gewinn der franz&#246;sischen Kolonien in Kanada und der franz&#246;sischen Besitzungen in Indien 1763, jedoch auch der Verlust eines gro&#223;en Teils der nordamerikanischen Kolonien im Amerikanischen Unabh&#228;ngigkeitskrieg 1775-1783. Die schweren Herausforderungen und Bedrohungen, denen das Land durch das von Napoleon beherrschte Europa 1800-1814 ausgesetzt war, konnten erfolgreich &#252;berstanden und die weltweite Dominanz auf den Weltmeeren konnte ausgebaut werden. Im Jahr 1800 wurden die K&#246;nigreiche Gro&#223;britannien und Irland, die zuvor in Personalunion regiert worden waren, mit dem Act of Union zum Vereinigten K&#246;nigreich von Gro&#223;britannien und Irland verschmolzen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die zweite H&#228;lfte seiner Herrschaft war gepr&#228;gt von einer zun&#228;chst sporadisch auftretenden und schlie&#223;lich permanenten Geisteskrankheit. Heute wird angenommen, diese sei durch eine Stoffwechselst&#246;rung (Porphyrie) verursacht worden. 1811 hatte sich sein Geisteszustand derart verschlechtert, dass sein &#228;ltester Sohn als Regent eingesetzt werden musste und die Amtsgesch&#228;fte &#252;bernahm. Dieser trat dann 1820 als Georg IV. die Thronfolge an.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wegen seines relativ bescheidenen Lebensstils und seiner Vorliebe f&#252;r das Landleben erhielt Georg III. den Spitznamen "Farmer George" (Bauer Georg).</German>

Dezember 1263[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]H&#229;kon IV. H&#229;konsson wurde als Sohn von K&#246;nig H&#229;kon Sverresson und dessen Nebenfrau Inga von Varteig (? 1234) angesehen und war von 1217 bis 1263 K&#246;nig von Norwegen. Er war der letzte K&#246;nig der B&#252;rgerkriegsperiode zwischen Birkebeinern und Baglern. Er wird oftmals auch H&#229;kon der Alte (norw. H&#229;kon Gamle) genannt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Nachweis seiner v&#228;terlichen Abstammung 1218 durch die Eisenprobe seiner Mutter st&#228;rkte seine Stellung entscheidend und verbesserte auch sein Verh&#228;ltnis zur Kirche. 1219 wurde er mit 15 Jahren m&#252;ndig, aber er richtete sich noch bis zum Herbst 1220 nach Skule. Da &#252;bernahm er wahrscheinlich die Herrschaft &#252;ber zwei Drittel des Reiches, was aber erst f&#252;r das Fr&#252;hjahr 1222 feststeht. In diesem Jahr vereinbarte er mit Erzbischof Guttorm f&#252;r 1223 einen Reichstag in Bergen. Der sollte sein K&#246;nigsvorrecht vor allen anderen Kronpr&#228;tendenten festlegen. Bei dieser Gelegenheit erhielt der Erzbischof als einziger und erster Bischof ein M&#252;nzprivileg f&#252;r Norwegen. Er best&#228;tigte auch alle fr&#252;her einger&#228;umten Rechte der Kirche und nahm sie unter seinen k&#246;niglichen Schutz. Das deutet auf eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Abh&#228;ngigkeit in dieser Phase von der Kirche hin.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Reichstag zu Bergen 1223 hatte noch mehr Teilnehmer als der von 1218 und repr&#228;sentierte alle Schichten und Landschaften des Reiches. Hier wurde H&#229;kon als K&#246;nig endg&#252;ltig best&#228;tigt. Der Erzbischof verk&#252;ndete diese Best&#228;tigung in einer &#252;bergeordneten Funktion. Au&#223;erdem wurde die Reichsteilung zwischen dem K&#246;nig und Jarl Skuli erneuert, wobei Skule &#252;ber sein Drittel, das &#216;stland darstellte, hinaus noch Sunnm&#248;re erhielt. H&#229;kon heiratete 1225 Skules Tochter Margarete. Er musste sich noch mit den Ribbungene herumschlagen. Aber deren F&#252;hrer, Junker Knut, nahm einen Vergleich an und heiratete 1227 eine andere Tochter Skules, Ingrid Skuledatter. 1227 lief der B&#252;rgerkrieg dann f&#252;r l&#228;ngere Zeit aus bis zum Aufstand Skules im Jahre 1239. Dieser endete mit dem Tode Skules 1240. Inzwischen war Sigurd Eindridesson Tafse Erzbischof von Nidaros geworden. Er versuchte vergeblich, als Gegenleistung zur kirchlichen Kr&#246;nung weitere Privilegien f&#252;r die Kirche zu erreichen. 1246 entsandte Papst Innozenz IV. seinen Kardinal Wilhelm von Modena, damit dieser K&#246;nig H&#229;kon kr&#246;nte. Der Kardinal versuchte auf Anraten der Bisch&#246;fe H&#229;kon dazu zu bewegen, den Kr&#246;nungseid von K&#246;nig Magnus Erlingsson zu wiederholen. Doch H&#229;kon schlug das rundweg ab. Die kirchliche Kr&#246;nung fand 1247 statt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Jahre 1262 hatten die Isl&#228;nder einen Vertrag mit K&#246;nig H&#229;kon &#252;ber seine K&#246;nigsherrschaft geschlossen. Damit wurde Hakon der K&#246;nig Islands, eines freien Landes mit bestimmten Berechtigungen und Pflichten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als dann 1262 die Schotten die Orkneys angriffen, fuhr er 1263 nach allgemeiner Mobilmachung mit einer gro&#223;en Flotte von Bergen &#252;ber die Shetlands im August nach Schottland. Nach einer unentschieden ausgegangenen Schlacht mit den Schotten bei Largs zog er sich f&#252;r den Winter auf die Orkneys zur&#252;ck, erkrankte dort und starb am 16. Dezember 1263. Im Frieden von Perth verkaufte Norwegen 1266 seine Besitzungen (au&#223;er Orkney) an Schottland.</German>

She was the second Queen regnant of Portugal and the Algarves, and the 29th or 30th Portuguese monarch. She was a member of the House of Braganza.[NEWLINE]Born as Maria da Gl&#243;ria Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, Maria da Gl&#243;ria was the daughter of the future King of Portugal and first Emperor of Brazil, Peter IV and his first wife Maria Leopoldina, Archduchess of Austria, herself a daughter of Emperor Francis II. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Maria is the only European monarch to not have been born in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Maria's grandfather King John VI died in March 1826, there was a succession crisis in Portugal. The king had a male heir, Peter, but Peter had proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822 and he was then Emperor Peter I of that country. The late king also had a younger son, Miguel, but he was exiled in Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.[NEWLINE]Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite granddaughter, Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until "the legitimate heir returned to the Kingdom" but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir. Peter, the liberal Emperor of Brazil, or Miguel, the absolutist exiled prince?[PARAGRAPH:2]Most people considered Peter to be the legitimate heir, but nobody wanted him to unite Portugal and Brazil's thrones again. The European country had been under Brazilian rule when both were part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, established by the King John VI during his stay in Rio de Janeiro from 1808 until 1820. Aware that his brother's supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him in the throne, Peter decided for a more consensual option; he abdicated the throne to his eldest daughter, Maria da Glria (who was only seven years old), and she should marry her uncle Miguel, who should accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece was an adult.[PARAGRAPH:2]Miguel pretended to accept, but when he arrived in Portugal he deposed Maria and proclaimed himself King, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign of terror, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her grandfather's in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter abdicated the Brazilian throne in 1831 in favor of his son (and Maria's younger brother, Peter II), and from his base in the Azores he attacked Miguel, forcing him to abdicate in 1834. Maria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 26, 1835 she married (at the age of fifteen) to Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugne de Beauharnais, and grandson of Empress Josephine. However, he died only two months later on March 28, 1835.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 1, 1836 Maria married again, to the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who ruled with her as a co-monarch. He received the title of King in 1837, in accordance with Portuguese custom, upon the birth of their first child Peter, an heir to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria's reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 16, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European upheavals of 1848. Maria's reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]After constant pregnancies and births, doctors warned Maria of the dangers of giving birth nearly every year. However, she ignored the risks that had killed her mother, who had died of complications following a miscarriage after many births; "If I die, I die at my post", Maria said. In 1853 she died while giving birth to her eleventh child, Prince Eugene, who also died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person, who always acted according to her convictions in the attempt to help her country. She was later given the surname "The Good Mother." Also, in 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.</English>

Herzogin von Porto war Knigin von Portugal von 1826 bis 1828 und von 1834 bis 1853. Sie war die letzte Herrscherin aus dem Haus Braganza.[NEWLINE]Geboren als Maria da Glria Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, war Maria die lteste Tochter von Peter IV. von Portugal und dessen erster Gemahlin Maria Leopoldine von sterreich. Ihr Vater hatte 1821 die brasilianische Unabhngigkeit erklrt und sich zum Kaiser Peter I. von Brasilien ausrufen lassen. 1826 erbte er zustzlich noch den portugiesischen Thron, den er als Peter IV. bestieg. Da es ihm nicht mglich war, beide Reiche Portugal und Brasilien gleichzeitig zu regieren, trat er schon nach wenigen Monaten als portugiesischer Knig zugunsten von Maria zurck. Diese bestieg so 1826 zum ersten Mal den portugiesischen Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria war zu diesem Zeitpunkt gerade sieben Jahre alt und regierte deshalb whrend ihrer ersten Herrschaftsperiode nur dem Namen nach. Ihr Vater hatte seinen jngeren Bruder, Prinz Michael, der sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt wegen seiner Opposition gegen eine konstitutionelle Monarchie in Portugal (Michael wollte absolutistisch regieren) gerade im Exil in Wien befand, zum Regenten fr Maria berufen, nachdem dieser die von Peter dem Land gegebene Verfassung, die Charta akzeptiert hatte. Spter htte sie ihren Onkel Michael heiraten und mit diesem gemeinsam das Land regieren sollen. In Wien wurde sogar eine Stellvertreterhochzeit gefeiert.[PARAGRAPH:2]Michael hatte allerdings andere Plne. Nachdem er nach Portugal zurckgekehrt war, setzte er die Charta auer Kraft, erklrte Maria II. fr abgesetzt und sich selbst zum Knig. Maria verlor so 1828 zunchst ihren Thron.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter war nicht bereit, diesen Vertrauensbruch seines Bruders hinzunehmen. Er dankte 1831 auch als Herrscher von Brasilien ab, ging nach Europa, um dort den Kampf gegen seinen Bruder und fr den Thron seiner Tochter aufzunehmen. Es begann der Miguelistenkrieg, der 1834 mit einer Niederlage Michaels endete. Maria, seit 1833 Herzogin von Porto, wurde dadurch erneut Knigin, kurze Zeit spter starb ihr Vater, sie wurde von den Cortes fr volljhrig erklrt und begann selbstndig zu regieren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Knigin Maria II. von Portugal: Die Regierungszeit Maria II. gehrt zu den bewegtesten Perioden der portugiesischen Geschichte. Die Konstitutionalisten, also die Anhnger der konstitutionellen Monarchie, hatten sich in einen rechtsliberal-konservativen (die sog. Cartisten) und einen linksliberalen Flgel (die Setembristen) gespalten. Die Regierungszeit Marias war geprgt von der Auseinandersetzung zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen, die sogar zu einem offenen Brgerkrieg fhrte. Die Knigin stand dabei auf Seiten der Cartisten, in Zeiten, in denen die Setembristen die Oberhand hatten, untersttzte sie zum Teil offen die cartistischen Krfte (siehe Belenzada).[PARAGRAPH:2]Antnio Bernardo da Costa Cabral, der Markgraf von Tomar, war whrend ihrer Regentschaft viele Jahre Ministerprsident und regierte das Land diktatorisch. Die Knigin hielt an ihm gegen groe Widerstnde im Lande fest, was das Land an den Rand eines Brgerkriegs brachte.[PARAGRAPH:2]In erster Ehe heiratete Maria 1835 August Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg (1810-1835). Dieser verstarb bereits zwei Monate nach der Eheschlieung an der Spanischen Grippe. 1836 vermhlte sie sich in zweiter Ehe mit Ferdinand II. aus dem Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha. Das Wappen der portugiesischen Knige von Johann II. bis Manuel II.[PARAGRAPH:2]1853 starb die Knigin bei der Geburt ihres elften Kindes im Alter von nur 34 Jahren. Whrend ihrer Regentschaft hatte sie ein exemplarisches Familienleben mit ihrem Ehemann Ferdinand von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha gefhrt. Die Knigin bedauerte oft, dass die politisch auergewhnlich turbulenten Zeiten ihr nicht gengend Zeit lieen, die sie ihrer Familie widmen konnte. Sie wurde als gutmtige Knigin und beispielhafte Ehefrau und Mutter von ihrem Volk verehrt, andererseits wegen ihrer konservativen Ansichten oft auch scharf kritisiert. Neben ihrem Festhalten an erzkonservativen Politikern wie Costa Cabral und Saldanha wurde besonders kritisiert, dass sie sich auch in ihrem Palast mit einer konservativen Kamarilla umgab, die die Handlungen der Knigin zum Teil sehr beeinflussten. Besonders in der Kritik stand hier der deutsche Erzieher ihrer Kinder, Dr. Dietz, den Ferdinand mit nach Portugal gebracht hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit der Regentschaft Maria II. endete in Portugal die Herrschaft des Hauses Braganza. Marias Nachfolger wurde ihr ltester Sohn, Peter V. ber ihn kam das Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha in Portugal zur Macht, die letzte Dynastie, die Portugal regieren sollte.</German>

The late king also had a younger son, Miguel, but he was exiled in Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.[NEWLINE]Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite granddaughter, Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until "the legitimate heir returned to the Kingdom" but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir. Peter, the liberal Emperor of Brazil, or Miguel, the absolutist exiled prince?[PARAGRAPH:2]Most people considered Peter to be the legitimate heir, but nobody wanted him to unite Portugal and Brazil's thrones again. The European country had been under Brazilian rule when both were part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, established by the King John VI during his stay in Rio de Janeiro from 1808 until 1820. Aware that his brother's supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him in the throne, Peter decided for a more consensual option; he abdicated the throne to his eldest daughter, Maria da Glria (who was only seven years old), and she should marry her uncle Miguel, who should accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece was an adult.[PARAGRAPH:2]Miguel pretended to accept, but when he arrived in Portugal he deposed Maria and proclaimed himself King, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign of terror, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her grandfather's in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter abdicated the Brazilian throne in 1831 in favor of his son (and Maria's younger brother, Peter II), and from his base in the Azores he attacked Miguel, forcing him to abdicate in 1834. Maria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 26, 1835 she married (at the age of fifteen) to Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugne de Beauharnais, and grandson of Empress Josephine. However, he died only two months later on March 28, 1835.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 1, 1836 Maria married again, to the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who ruled with her as a co-monarch. He received the title of King in 1837, in accordance with Portuguese custom, upon the birth of their first child Peter, an heir to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria's reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 16, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European upheavals of 1848. Maria's reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]After constant pregnancies and births, doctors warned Maria of the dangers of giving birth nearly every year. However, she ignored the risks that had killed her mother, who had died of complications following a miscarriage after many births; "If I die, I die at my post", Maria said. In 1853 she died while giving birth to her eleventh child, Prince Eugene, who also died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person, who always acted according to her convictions in the attempt to help her country. She was later given the surname "The Good Mother." Also, in 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.</Spanish>

He spent much of his early life in Constantinople (actual Istanbul) as a grain merchant, looking after Venetian interests. In the late 1490s he was using his commercial correspondence for sending encoded information to Venice regarding the movements of the Turkish navy. In 1499, he was imprisoned on charges of espionage, but escaped execution due to his friendship with the vizier, and was released several years later.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the early sixteenth century, Venice lost nearly all its territory on the Italian mainland, and Gritti played an important part in the events connected with this loss and the eventual return to the status quo ante. In 1509, after the Venetian defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, Gritti was appointed as proveditor to the Venetian army in Treviso; ordered by the Council of Ten to support revolts against the invaders, he successfully engineered the return of Padua to Venetian hands, and its subsequent defence against the Emperor. In 1510, following the death of Nicolo di Pitigliano, Gritti took command of Venice's army, but was forced to withdraw to Venice by French advances. He continued as proveditor through end of the League of Cambrai and the subsequent war of the Holy League. In 1512, he led the negotiations with Francis I that resulted in Venice leaving the League and allying with France.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars. He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a new war with the Ottomans. His dogaressa was Benedetta Vendramin. He died in 1538.</English>

In den n&#228;chsten zwei Jahren wies er ihre R&#252;ckkehrversuche ab. Somit erlangte er auch die tats&#228;chliche Herrschaft. Einer der Neffen, Dausprungas Sohn Tautvilas, lie&#223; sich in Riga taufen und erlangte so die Unterst&#252;tzung des Deutschen Ordens. Mindaugas musste nachziehen. Auch er lie&#223; sich 1251 taufen und empfing daraufhin 1253 vom Papst die K&#246;nigskrone. Sp&#228;ter s&#246;hnte er sich mit Tautvilas aus.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mindaugas verb&#252;ndete sich auch mit Daniel von Galizien (? 1264), der sich damals gegen die Goldene Horde auflehnte. Eine Heirat zwischen Mindaugas' Tochter und Daniels Sohn Svarno verband zudem beide H&#228;user (1255). Das B&#252;ndnis blieb fruchtlos, die Tataren zwangen 1258/59 beide zur Flucht. Das schw&#228;chte Mindaugas' Position gegen&#252;ber den Schemaiten, die am 13. Juli 1260 in der Schlacht an der Durbe dem Deutschen Orden eine schwere Niederlage beibringen konnten - und zwar ohne Mindaugas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mindaugas wandte sich wieder vom Christentum ab (wobei diese Tatsache umstritten bleibt) und verb&#252;ndete sich nun mit den heidnisch gebliebenen Schemaiten seines Neffen Treniota gegen den Orden. Aber der Feldzug 1261 blieb erfolglos und Mindaugas war unglaubw&#252;rdig geworden, sodass ihn sein Schwager Daumantas und Treniota im Herbst 1263 samt zweier S&#246;hne ermorden konnten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mindaugas Sohn Vaisalga &#252;bernahm 1264 die Regierung, trat aber wieder zur&#252;ck und wurde bald ebenfalls ermordet. Bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts herrschte dann weitgehende Unordnung in Litauen, so dass selbst &#252;ber die Lebensdaten der Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten Unklarheiten bestehen.</German>

		<English>[H1]Vytautas the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Grand Duke of Lithuania[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c. 1350 - October 27, 1430 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born in 1350 in the castle of present-day Senieji Trakai ("Old Trakai"), Vytautas was the son of Kestutis with his second wife Birute, cousin of Jogaila, who became King of Poland as Wladyslaw II, and grandfather of Vasili II of Russia. Vytautas' father and his uncle Algirdas, were brothers and did not compete for power. Algirdas was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Kestutis was primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila, became Grand Duke. The harmonious relationship of his father and uncle ended, and a struggle for power between them ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiskes with the Teutonic Knights against Kestutis. When Kestutis discovered this in the following year, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, Jogaila managed to escape and raised an army against Kestutis, and his son Vytautas. The two opposing sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kestutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kestutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate amongst historians.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1382, Vytautas was able to escape from Kreva. After the escape, he sought help from the Teutonic Knights. At the time Jogaila was negotiating with the Teutonic Order. They formulated the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order some territory of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified. In summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order started up again. Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January 1384, Vytautas again promised to cede part of Samogitia, to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevezis River in return for the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, in July of the same year, Vytautas decided to abandon the Teutonic Knights and reconciled with Jogaila. He then proceeded to burn three important Teutonic castles, and he redeemed all Kestutis' lands, except for Trakai. Vytautas participated in the signing of Union of Kreva with Poland in 1385 and he was re-baptised in 1386 in the Catholic rite, receiving the name Alexander.[PARAGRAPH:2]This treaty provided for the marriage of Jogaila to Jadwiga of Poland, and for him to become the King of Poland. He left his brother Skirgaila as a regent of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, he was unpopular with the people and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become the Grand Duke again. In 1389 he started a war and attacked Vilnius but failed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was forced to ask the Teutonic Knights for help for the second time in the beginning of 1390. Vytautas had to promise to keep the original agreement of 1384, and turn over Samogitia to the Order. His army now attacked Lithuanian lands. To further advance his influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Russia in 1391.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Polish nobility was unhappy that Jogaila, their new king, now Wladyslaw II Jagiello, spent too much time on the affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not bring any benefit to the country, thus wanted to avoid any further conflicts between Poland and Lithuania[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1398, Vytautas' army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to the ethnic Lithuania. Inspired by this successful campaign, Vytautas and Wladyslaw II Jagiello won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Grand Duchy of Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mongol campaign resulted in total defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler and not re-conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. In 1408 Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitia matters.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising, backed by Vytautas, against the Teutonic Knights started. The rebels burned Skirsnemune castle. Since both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels, the war started. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410 Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald (also called the Battle of Tannenberg). The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received Samogitia for his lifetime.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horodlo with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January of 1429 Vytautas already had received the title of King of Lithuania with the backing of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by Polish magnates in autumn of 1430. Another crown was sent, but Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle several days before it reached Lithuania. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost.</English>

		<German>[H1]Vytautas der Gro&#223;e[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Gro&#223;f&#252;rst von Litauen[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte:[\BOLD] 1350 - 27. Oktober 1430[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Nach dem Tod des Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten Algirdas (? 1377) folgte ihm sein Sohn Jogaila auf den Thron, der aber die langj&#228;hrige Dyarchie, die zwischen seinem Vater und dessen Bruder, dem Herzog von Trakai Kestutis bestanden hatte, nicht beibehalten wollte. So brach zu Beginn der 1380er Jahre ein B&#252;rgerkrieg zwischen Onkel und Neffe aus, in den auch Vytautas als Sohn des Kestutis und Neffe des letzten Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten involviert war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Verhandlungen zwischen Jogaila und dem Deutschen Orden dienten Kestutis 1381 als Anlass, den rechtm&#228;&#223;igen Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten aus Vilnius zu vertreiben und sich selbst als Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten anerkennen zu lassen. Der Staatsstreich scheiterte jedoch 1382, als Kestutis und Vytautas bei Verhandlungen von Jogaila gefangen genommen wurden; ersterer starb im Gef&#228;ngnis (m&#246;glicherweise wurde er ermordet), Vytautas konnte als Frau verkleidet von dort entkommen und floh nach Preu&#223;en zum Deutschen Orden, dem Erbfeind der Litauer. 1383 nahm er den katholischen Glauben an, lie&#223; sich auf den Namen Wigand taufen und zog mit Unterst&#252;tzung der Ordensritter gegen Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:2]Diese Unterst&#252;tzung hatte er sich mit dem Versprechen gesichert, Niederlitauen an den Orden abzutreten, womit dieser seine Territorien in Ostpreu&#223;en und Livland h&#228;tte verbinden k&#246;nnen. Doch bereits 1384 wandte sich Vytautas gegen seine Verb&#252;ndeten; im Kampf um ein Machtgleichgewicht in der Region kam es zu einer Ann&#228;herung der beiden Rivalen. So billigte Vytautas Jogailas Bem&#252;hungen um eine Heirat mit der polnischen K&#246;nigin Jadwiga (? 1399), die von Erfolg gekr&#246;nt waren: Unter dem Namen Wladyslaw II. heiratete Jogaila am 4. M&#228;rz 1387.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas, der sich erst im Jahre zuvor orthodox hatte taufen lassen und bei dieser Gelegenheit den Namen Alexander erhalten hatte, wurde nun erneut katholisch. Er bekleidete hohe Positionen im neuen Staat, nutzte jedoch die Verlagerung der Macht Jogailas nach Polen, um seine Macht im Gebiet des fast verwaisten Gro&#223;f&#252;rstentums Litauen zu st&#228;rken und setzte sich dazu zwischen 1389 und 1391 an die Spitze einer Gruppe polnischer Adliger, die mit der Litauischen Herrschaft - einer der Br&#252;der Jogailas war hier eingesetzt worden - unzufrieden waren und ihn u.a. bei dem Versuch unterst&#252;tzten, Vilnius einzunehmen. Trotz seiner Misserfolge, die auch die Unterst&#252;tzung durch den Deutschen Orden nicht verhindern konnte, vergr&#246;&#223;erte sich seine Anh&#228;ngerschaft, und um weitere Angriffe zu vermeiden, begann Jogaila mit seinem Cousin zu verhandeln. Im Ostrower Vertrag, auf Gut Ostrowo bei Lida unterzeichnet, setzte er 1392 Vytautas mit dem Titel des Gro&#223;f&#252;rsten als seinen Statthalter in Litauen ein.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die rasche Entwicklung Litauens erm&#246;glichte es Vytautas, 1429 den gro&#223;en europ&#228;ischen F&#252;rstenkongre&#223; von Luzk zu veranstalten. Kaiser Sigismund regte an, Vytautas zum K&#246;nig von Litauen zu kr&#246;nen, ein Vorschlag, dem Jogaila zustimmte. Doch lie&#223;en die polnischen Adligen den Boten mit der Krone nicht passieren, w&#228;hrend Vytautas in Erwartung der Krone in Vilnius verstarb. Da Vytautas keine S&#246;hne hinterlie&#223;, fiel die litauische Gro&#223;f&#252;rstenw&#252;rde zun&#228;chst an Svitrigaila (~1370-1452), einen weiteren Sohn des Algirdas, sp&#228;ter dann unter Einflussnahme Jogailas 1432 an dessen anderen Bruder Zygimantas Kestutaitis, der allerdings 1440 ermordet wurde.</German>

Vytautas participated in the signing of Union of Kreva with Poland in 1385 and he was re-baptised in 1386 in the Catholic rite, receiving the name Alexander.[PARAGRAPH:2]This treaty provided for the marriage of Jogaila to Jadwiga of Poland, and for him to become the King of Poland. He left his brother Skirgaila as a regent of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, he was unpopular with the people and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become the Grand Duke again. In 1389 he started a war and attacked Vilnius but failed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was forced to ask the Teutonic Knights for help for the second time in the beginning of 1390. Vytautas had to promise to keep the original agreement of 1384, and turn over Samogitia to the Order. His army now attacked Lithuanian lands. To further advance his influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Russia in 1391.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Polish nobility was unhappy that Jogaila, their new king, now Wladyslaw II Jagiello, spent too much time on the affairs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not bring any benefit to the country, thus wanted to avoid any further conflicts between Poland and Lithuania[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1398, Vytautas' army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to the ethnic Lithuania. Inspired by this successful campaign, Vytautas and Wladyslaw II Jagiello won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Grand Duchy of Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mongol campaign resulted in total defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler and not re-conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. In 1408 Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitia matters.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising, backed by Vytautas, against the Teutonic Knights started. The rebels burned Skirsnemune castle. Since both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels, the war started. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410 Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald (also called the Battle of Tannenberg). The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received Samogitia for his lifetime.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horodlo with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January of 1429 Vytautas already had received the title of King of Lithuania with the backing of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by Polish magnates in autumn of 1430. Another crown was sent, but Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle several days before it reached Lithuania. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost.</Italian>

Vytautas' father and his uncle Algirdas, were brothers and did not compete for power. Algirdas was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Kestutis was primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Knights.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila, became Grand Duke. The harmonious relationship of his father and uncle ended, and a struggle for power between them ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiskes with the Teutonic Knights against Kestutis. When Kestutis discovered this in the following year, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, Jogaila managed to escape and raised an army against Kestutis, and his son Vytautas. The two opposing sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kestutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kestutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate amongst historians.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1382, Vytautas was able to escape from Kreva. After the escape, he sought help from the Teutonic Knights. At the time Jogaila was negotiating with the Teutonic Order. They formulated the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order some territory of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified. In summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order started up again. Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila.[PARAGRAPH:2]In January 1384, Vytautas again promised to cede part of Samogitia, to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevezis River in return for the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania.

		<English>[H1]Karl XII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 17, 1682 - November 30, 1718 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Carl XII, Karl XII or Carolus Rex, the Alexander of the North, nicknamed in Turkish as Demirbas Sarl (Charles the Habitu&#233;), was a King of Sweden from 1697 until his death in 1718. He was the fourth king of the Wittelsbach dynasty in Sweden. As a child, many people thought he was going to be sickly. This was proved to be wrong, though: he hardened his body for war by riding on horseback and hunting the wolves of Sweden's fir forests. When his father died, he was ready. He came to the throne at the age of fifteen and left the country three years later to embark on a series of battles overseas, that briefly made Sweden the predominant power in Northern Europe. These battles were part of the Great Northern War, and many of them were fought against Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia. His youth gave other nations a decent pretext with which to invade Sweden; Saxony, Denmark-Norway, Poland and Russia joined in a coalition to attack Sweden, beginning the Great Northern War. Charles XII turned out to be more astute than the other powers imagined, a great tactician, defeating all of the invaders. However, his strong tactical abilities were not accompanied by strategic and political wisdom. He is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the Great Northern War, "I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies." He took this resolution to an extreme level, which eventually resulted in the end of the Swedish Empire and its dominance of the southern Baltic Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles's first campaign was against Denmark, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark, which threatened a Swedish ally, Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp (another cousin of Charles XII, and married to his sister Hedvig Sophia). Denmark's defeat, however, and Sweden's ensuing rise to prominence in the Baltic region was viewed suspiciously by two powerful neighbors, King August II of Poland (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark) and Peter the Great of Russia. Russia responded by occupying the Swedish territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian garrison at Battle of Narva. From the very beginning, this seemed to be a headstrong move. The Swedish army of ten thousand men was outnumbered four to one by the Russians. Still, Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, and effectively split the Russian army in two. Many of Peter's troops that fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River and the battle was a crushing Swedish victory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles, despite advice from his advisors, didn't pursue the Russian army. Instead, he then turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, disregarding Polish negotiation proposals, supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many important cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of the king of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII filled the void with his own man, Stanislas Leszczynski .[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, while Charles enjoyed easy victories in the Commonwealth, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a giant military reform plan that soon begun to bear fruit. The new Russian army was a much tougher one than the one defeated at Narva. Russian forces had managed to retake Livonia and even established a new city Saint Petersburg there. This prompted Charles to make the fatal decision to attack the Russian heartland with an assault on Moscow, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, ataman of the Cossacks. Peter the Great managed to cripple Swedish forces near the Baltic coast before Charles managed to combine his forces, and Charles' Polish ally, Stanislaw Leszczynski, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine but the Russians destroyed the rebel army before they could aid the Swedes. The harsh climate took its toll as well, as Charles marched his troops through Ukraine. By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his vulnerable supply train destroyed. The king himself, incapacitated by a coma resulting from his injuries, was unable to rally the Swedish forces. The battle was a disaster, and Charles fled south to the Ottoman Empire, where he set up camp at Bender with about 1000 men who were called Caroleans ("Karoliner" in Swedish). The Poltava Swedish disaster marked both the end of the Swedish Empire and the rise of Russian Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Turks initially welcomed the Swedish king, who managed to incite a war between the Ottomans and the Russians. However the sultan Ahmed III eventually tired of Charles' endless scheming and ordered his arrest. Meanwhile, the king's old enemies Russia and Poland took advantage of his absence to regain and even expand their lost territories. England, an ally of the Swedes, defected from their alliance obligations while the Prussians also attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia seized Finland and Augustus II regained the Polish throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seeing his very kingdom threatened, Charles fled the Ottoman Empire and rode across Europe in just fifteen days to return to Swedish Pomerania. His efforts to reestablish his lost empire failed, however, when he was killed by a bullet during his second siege of the fortress Fredriksten in Danish-controlled Norway. There has been some speculations that he was not killed by a stray bullet but by one fired from the Swedish side, making his death an assassination (at the time he was not very popular in Sweden due to the hardships the people suffered because of the constant wars) but a conclusion has never been reached. He was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleanora.[PARAGRAPH:2]His death is one of countless trivial disagreements between Norway and Sweden, both sides claiming the kill. It is not uncommon for the Norwegian media to end articles concerning Sweden with the line PS: We shot Charles XII![PARAGRAPH:2]Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and women, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. The king brought Sweden to its pinnacle of prestige and power through his brilliant campaigning. However, his over-ambitious invasion of Russia coupled with the overwhelming power of a revived anti-Swedish coalition brought Sweden's downfall as a Great Power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apart from being a monarch, the King's interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is attributed to having invented an octal numeral system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because of all cubic boxes used for materials such as gunpowder. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched down a model of his thought on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later, but has since been lost. Several historians of science suspect that either the multi-talented Emanuel Swedenborg or the brilliant inventor Christopher Polhem also present at the meeting in Lund 1716 may have been the true inventor behind this feat, or at least a main contributor.</English>

Dezember 1697 im Alter von f&#252;nfzehn Jahren zum K&#246;nig von Schweden gekr&#246;nt, als der schwedische Reichstag (die vier schwedischen Reichsst&#228;nde) ihn f&#252;r vollj&#228;hrig erkl&#228;rte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit Karl XII. endet die schwedische Gro&#223;machtstellung und das seit 1611 w&#228;hrende Ringen um die Ostseeherrschaft, um das so genannte Dominium Maris Baltici. Russland l&#246;ste Schweden nach dem Nordischen Krieg als Gro&#223;macht ab.[PARAGRAPH:2]Karls XII. Rang als Feldherr ist in der Milit&#228;rgeschichte umstritten. Er war zwar ein gro&#223;er Taktiker, ein nur noch eigenwillig zu nennender Stratege (sein sechs Jahre w&#228;hrender Polenfeldzug hat Russlands Aufstieg erm&#246;glicht), jedoch ein schlechter Diplomat. Er hatte mehrfach die Angebote zu einem Siegfrieden ausgeschlagen (beispielsweise hatte August ihm 1701 und 1702 mehrfach Kurland und Polnisch Livland, und ein B&#252;ndnis gegen Peter angeboten). Karl verfolgte weiter sein wohl illusion&#228;res Ziel, in Polen und Russland schwedische Vasallen auf den Thron zu bringen. Keine hundert Jahre nach Karls Tod hatte Schweden all seine Besitzungen au&#223;erhalb des Mutterlandes im Ostseeraum (einschlie&#223;lich Finnland) verloren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich war seine Abstinenz gegen&#252;ber Frauen und Alkohol. Es gibt aber keinerlei Hinweise auf eine Homosexualit&#228;t. Seit dem Sieg von Narva war der Krieg sein Element - er hatte aber niemals von sich aus einen Krieg begonnen. Schon in seiner Jugend h&#228;rtete er sich ab; so ging er - nur mit einem Speer bewaffnet - auf winterliche B&#228;renjagd. Ein Beispiel f&#252;r seine Ausdauer und seine F&#228;higkeit gro&#223;e Strapazen zu ertragen ist auch sein oben erw&#228;hnter Gewaltritt von der T&#252;rkei nach Stralsund. Sein Mitgef&#252;hl war weniger stark ausgepr&#228;gt. Zu den russischen Verw&#252;stungen in seinen Provinzen Livland und Ingermanland meinte er nur, dass sie "den Boden ja wohl nicht wegtragen k&#246;nnten". Er hatte ein empfindliches Rechtsgef&#252;hl und konnte Verrat nicht verzeihen, wie beispielsweise der Fall Patkuls zeigt, den er sich von den Sachsen ausliefern und dann r&#228;dern lie&#223;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der K&#246;nig interessierte sich f&#252;r Schach und Mathematik und konnte gro&#223;e Zahlen im Kopf multiplizieren. Die Erfindung des oktalen Zahlensystems wird ihm zugeschrieben, obwohl einige Wissenschaftshistoriker vermuten, dass entweder Emanuel Swedenborg oder Christopher Polhem die eigentlichen Erfinder seien. Er sprach flie&#223;end Deutsch und Latein und konnte auch Franz&#246;sisch, weigerte sich aber, in der damaligen Diplomatensprache zu reden.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Karl XII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 17, 1682 - November 30, 1718 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Carl XII, Karl XII or Carolus Rex, the Alexander of the North, nicknamed in Turkish as Demirbas Sarl (Charles the Habitu&#233;), was a King of Sweden from 1697 until his death in 1718. He was the fourth king of the Wittelsbach dynasty in Sweden. As a child, many people thought he was going to be sickly. This was proved to be wrong, though: he hardened his body for war by riding on horseback and hunting the wolves of Sweden's fir forests. When his father died, he was ready. He came to the throne at the age of fifteen and left the country three years later to embark on a series of battles overseas, that briefly made Sweden the predominant power in Northern Europe. These battles were part of the Great Northern War, and many of them were fought against Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia. His youth gave other nations a decent pretext with which to invade Sweden; Saxony, Denmark-Norway, Poland and Russia joined in a coalition to attack Sweden, beginning the Great Northern War. Charles XII turned out to be more astute than the other powers imagined, a great tactician, defeating all of the invaders. However, his strong tactical abilities were not accompanied by strategic and political wisdom. He is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the Great Northern War, "I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies." He took this resolution to an extreme level, which eventually resulted in the end of the Swedish Empire and its dominance of the southern Baltic Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles's first campaign was against Denmark, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark, which threatened a Swedish ally, Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp (another cousin of Charles XII, and married to his sister Hedvig Sophia). Denmark's defeat, however, and Sweden's ensuing rise to prominence in the Baltic region was viewed suspiciously by two powerful neighbors, King August II of Poland (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark) and Peter the Great of Russia. Russia responded by occupying the Swedish territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian garrison at Battle of Narva. From the very beginning, this seemed to be a headstrong move. The Swedish army of ten thousand men was outnumbered four to one by the Russians. Still, Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, and effectively split the Russian army in two. Many of Peter's troops that fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River and the battle was a crushing Swedish victory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles, despite advice from his advisors, didn't pursue the Russian army. Instead, he then turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, disregarding Polish negotiation proposals, supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many important cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of the king of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII filled the void with his own man, Stanislas Leszczynski .[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, while Charles enjoyed easy victories in the Commonwealth, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a giant military reform plan that soon begun to bear fruit. The new Russian army was a much tougher one than the one defeated at Narva. Russian forces had managed to retake Livonia and even established a new city Saint Petersburg there. This prompted Charles to make the fatal decision to attack the Russian heartland with an assault on Moscow, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, ataman of the Cossacks. Peter the Great managed to cripple Swedish forces near the Baltic coast before Charles managed to combine his forces, and Charles' Polish ally, Stanislaw Leszczynski, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine but the Russians destroyed the rebel army before they could aid the Swedes. The harsh climate took its toll as well, as Charles marched his troops through Ukraine. By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his vulnerable supply train destroyed. The king himself, incapacitated by a coma resulting from his injuries, was unable to rally the Swedish forces. The battle was a disaster, and Charles fled south to the Ottoman Empire, where he set up camp at Bender with about 1000 men who were called Caroleans ("Karoliner" in Swedish). The Poltava Swedish disaster marked both the end of the Swedish Empire and the rise of Russian Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Turks initially welcomed the Swedish king, who managed to incite a war between the Ottomans and the Russians. However the sultan Ahmed III eventually tired of Charles' endless scheming and ordered his arrest. Meanwhile, the king's old enemies Russia and Poland took advantage of his absence to regain and even expand their lost territories. England, an ally of the Swedes, defected from their alliance obligations while the Prussians also attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia seized Finland and Augustus II regained the Polish throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seeing his very kingdom threatened, Charles fled the Ottoman Empire and rode across Europe in just fifteen days to return to Swedish Pomerania. His efforts to reestablish his lost empire failed, however, when he was killed by a bullet during his second siege of the fortress Fredriksten in Danish-controlled Norway. There has been some speculations that he was not killed by a stray bullet but by one fired from the Swedish side, making his death an assassination (at the time he was not very popular in Sweden due to the hardships the people suffered because of the constant wars) but a conclusion has never been reached. He was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleanora.[PARAGRAPH:2]His death is one of countless trivial disagreements between Norway and Sweden, both sides claiming the kill. It is not uncommon for the Norwegian media to end articles concerning Sweden with the line PS: We shot Charles XII![PARAGRAPH:2]Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and women, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. The king brought Sweden to its pinnacle of prestige and power through his brilliant campaigning. However, his over-ambitious invasion of Russia coupled with the overwhelming power of a revived anti-Swedish coalition brought Sweden's downfall as a Great Power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apart from being a monarch, the King's interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is attributed to having invented an octal numeral system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because of all cubic boxes used for materials such as gunpowder. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched down a model of his thought on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later, but has since been lost. Several historians of science suspect that either the multi-talented Emanuel Swedenborg or the brilliant inventor Christopher Polhem also present at the meeting in Lund 1716 may have been the true inventor behind this feat, or at least a main contributor.</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Harun Al-Rashid[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Khalif of Baghdad[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 763 - 809 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Harun al-Rashid (also spelled Harun ar-Rashid, Haroun al-Rashid or Haroon al Rasheed; English: Aaron the Upright, Aaron the Just, or Aaron the Rightly-Guided) was the fifth and most famous Abbasid Caliph. Ruling from 786 until 809, his was a time of scientific, cultural, and religious prosperity. Art and music also flourished significantly during his reign. His life and his fabulous court over which he held sway has been the subject of many tales, some of them facts but most are believed to be fictitious. The famous The Book of One Thousand and One Nights contained many stories that might have been inspired by Harun's magnificent court. [PARAGRAPH:2] Harun was the son of al-Mahdi, the third 'Abbasid caliph (ruled 775-785), and al-Khayzuran, a former slave girl from Yemen and a woman of strong personality who greatly influenced affairs of state in the reigns of her husband and sons. Harun became caliph when he was in his early twenties. On the day of accession, his son al-Ma'mun was born, and al-Amin some little time later: the latter was the son of Zubaida, a granddaughter of al-Mansur (founder of the city of Baghdad); so he took precedence over the former, whose mother was a Persian slave-girl. He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved the condition of the people. [PARAGRAPH:2] It was under Harun ar-Rashid that Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period. Tribute was paid by many rulers to the caliph, and these funds were used on architecture, the arts and a luxurious life at court. Harun gave great encouragement to learning, poetry and music. He was a scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in his own kingdom, or in neighboring countries, he invited them to his court and treated them with respect. The name of Harun, therefore, became known throughout the world. He had diplomatic relations with China and with Charlemagne. [PARAGRAPH:2] In military matters, Harun was an excellent soldier and showed this ability at a young age when his father was still caliph. He later commanded an army of 95,000 Arabs and Persians sent by his father to invade the Byzantine Empire, formerly the Eastern Roman Empire, which was then ruled by the Empress Irene. After defeating Irene's famous general, Nicetas, Harun marched his army to Chrysopolis (now Uskudar in Turkey) on the Asiatic coast, opposite Constantinople. Irene agreed to pay tribute if Arabs left. The tribute of gold that the Empress Irene agreed to pay Harun was sent regularly for many years. It was always received at Baghdad with great ceremony. The day on which it arrived was made a holiday. The Byzantine soldiers who came with it entered the gates in procession. Muslim troops also took part in the parade. When the gold had been delivered at the palace, the Byzantine soldiers were hospitably entertained, and were escorted to the main gate of the city when they set out on their journey back to Constantinople.</English>

He was renamed to Alexios, and the emperor granted him the newly created senior court title of despotes. He was betrothed to the Emperor&#39;s daughter, Maria. B&#233;la&#39;s patrimony caused armed conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary between 1164 and 1167, because Stephen III attempted to hinder the Byzantines from taking control of Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. B&#233;la-Alexios, who was designated as Emperor Manuel&#39;s heir in 1165, took part in three Byzantine campaigns against Hungary. His betrothal to the emperor&#39;s daughter was dissolved after her brother, Alexios, was born in 1169. The emperor deprived B&#233;la of his high title, granting him the inferior rank of kaisar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and B&#233;la decided to return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged that he would never make war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords unanimously proclaimed B&#233;la king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of B&#233;la&#39;s alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III&#39;s approval. B&#233;la fought with his younger brother, G&#233;za, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel&#39;s death, B&#233;la reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.</Portuguese>

		<English>[H1]Basil II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Byzantine Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]958-1025[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Basil was the son of Emperor Romanos II by Theophano, whose family was of Armenian descent. In 960, he was associated on the throne by his father, but the latter died in 963, when Basil was only five years old. Because he and his brother, the future Emperor Constantine VIII (ruled 1025-1028), were too young to reign in their own right, Basil's mother Theophano married one of Romanos' leading generals, who took the throne as the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas several months later in 963. Nikephoros was murdered in 969, only to be succeeded by another general, who became Emperor John I Tzimisces and reigned for seven years. Finally, when John died on January 10, 976, Basil II took the throne as senior emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil was a brave soldier and a superb horseman; he was to prove himself a strong ruler and an able general. He did not at first display the full extent of his energy. In the early years of his reign, the administration remained in the hands of the eunuch Basil Lekapenos (an illegitimate son of Emperor Romanos I), president of the senate, a wily and gifted man, who hoped that the young emperors would be his puppet. Basil waited and watched without interfering, and devoted himself to learning the details of administrative business and instructing himself in military science.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Nikephoros II Phokas in particular had proven to be a brilliant military commander during his reign, both he and John I Tzimiskes had proven to be lax administrators. Although John had reportedly planned to curb the power of the landowners at the end of his reign, his death soon after speaking out against them led to his reported poisoning. As a result, Basil found himself with a serious problem as soon as his reign began. The great landowners of Asia Minor, Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas - who provided many of the empire's soldiers and taxes - were in open revolt against the empire. Basil, showing the penchant for ruthlessness that would become his trademark, took the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989).[PARAGRAPH:2]Having put an end to the internal strife, Basil II then turned his attention to the empire's other enemies. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the empire's position in the east and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch threatened by the enemy. In the 995, Basil II with an army of 40,000 men (with 80,000 mules), launched a campaign against the Muslim Arabs and won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south, sacking all of the cities from Emesa to Tripoli. Although he did not have sufficient forces to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire. No emperor since Heraclius had been able to hold these lands for any length of time, and they would remain Byzantine for the next 75 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil also wanted to restore to the empire territories that it had long lost. At the start of the second millennium, he took on his greatest adversary, Samuil of Bulgaria, who also was of Armenian descent. Bulgaria had been partly subjugated by John I Tzimiskes, but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control, under the leadership of Samuil and his brothers. As they raided Byzantine lands starting from 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissention by first allowing the escape of the captive emperor Boris II of Bulgaria. This having failed, Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead an army of 60,000 men into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets (Sofia) in 986. Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and headed back for Thrace but fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at Trajan's Gate at the Battle of Trayanovi Vrata.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil escaped with the help of his Varangian Guard and attempted to make up his losses by turning Samuil's brother Aron against him. Aron was tempted with Basil's offer of his own sister Anna in marriage, but the negotiations failed when Aron discovered that the bride he was sent was a fake. By 987 Aron had been eliminated by Samuil, and Basil was busy fighting both Skleros and Phokas in Asia Minor. Although the titular emperor Roman of Bulgaria was captured in 991, Basil lost Moesia to the Bulgarians. In 992, Basil II concluded a treaty with Pietro Orseolo II by the terms that Venice's custom duties in Constantinople would be reduced from 30 nomismata to 17 nomismata in return for the Venetians agreeing to transport Byzantine troops to southern Italy in times of war.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1000, Basil II was able to focus on his war with Bulgaria again. Samuil had extended his rule from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea and raided into central Greece, and Basil was determined to reverse the fortunes of the empire. In 1001-1002, the Byzantines were able to regain control of Moesia, and in 1003 he raided into Macedonia, taking Skopje. In 1005, the governor of Durazzo surrendered his city to the Byzantines. During the next several years, the Byzantines failed to make any significant gains.[PARAGRAPH:2]Finally, on July 29, 1014, Basil II outmaneuvered the Bulgarian army in the Battle of Kleidion, with Samuil separated from his force. Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their ruler, who fainted at the sight and died two days later suffering a stroke. Although this may be an exaggeration, this gave Basil his nickname Boulgaroktonos, "the Bulgar-slayer" in later tradition.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bulgaria fought on for four more years, but finally submitted in 1018. This victory and the later submission of the Serbs fulfilled one of Basil's goals, as the empire regained its ancient Danube River frontier for the first time in 400 years. Before returning to Constantinople, Basil II celebrated his triumph in Athens.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil II returned in triumph to Constantinople, then promptly went east and attacked the Persians over control of Armenia, which had become a Byzantine tributary when its king died in 1000. More victories followed, and Armenia rejoined the Byzantine empire for the first time in two centuries. Basil created in those highlands a strongly fortified frontier, which, if his successors had been capable, should have proved an effective barrier against the invasions of the Seljuk Turks.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the meantime, other Byzantine forces restored much of Southern Italy, lost over the previous 150 years, to the empire's control. When Basil finally died on December 15, 1025, he was planning a military expedition to recover the island of Sicily.</English>

Aron was tempted with Basil's offer of his own sister Anna in marriage, but the negotiations failed when Aron discovered that the bride he was sent was a fake. By 987 Aron had been eliminated by Samuil, and Basil was busy fighting both Skleros and Phokas in Asia Minor. Although the titular emperor Roman of Bulgaria was captured in 991, Basil lost Moesia to the Bulgarians. In 992, Basil II concluded a treaty with Pietro Orseolo II by the terms that Venice's custom duties in Constantinople would be reduced from 30 nomismata to 17 nomismata in return for the Venetians agreeing to transport Byzantine troops to southern Italy in times of war.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1000, Basil II was able to focus on his war with Bulgaria again. Samuil had extended his rule from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea and raided into central Greece, and Basil was determined to reverse the fortunes of the empire. In 1001-1002, the Byzantines were able to regain control of Moesia, and in 1003 he raided into Macedonia, taking Skopje. In 1005, the governor of Durazzo surrendered his city to the Byzantines. During the next several years, the Byzantines failed to make any significant gains.[PARAGRAPH:2]Finally, on July 29, 1014, Basil II outmaneuvered the Bulgarian army in the Battle of Kleidion, with Samuil separated from his force. Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their ruler, who fainted at the sight and died two days later suffering a stroke. Although this may be an exaggeration, this gave Basil his nickname Boulgaroktonos, "the Bulgar-slayer" in later tradition.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bulgaria fought on for four more years, but finally submitted in 1018. This victory and the later submission of the Serbs fulfilled one of Basil's goals, as the empire regained its ancient Danube River frontier for the first time in 400 years. Before returning to Constantinople, Basil II celebrated his triumph in Athens.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil II returned in triumph to Constantinople, then promptly went east and attacked the Persians over control of Armenia, which had become a Byzantine tributary when its king died in 1000. More victories followed, and Armenia rejoined the Byzantine empire for the first time in two centuries. Basil created in those highlands a strongly fortified frontier, which, if his successors had been capable, should have proved an effective barrier against the invasions of the Seljuk Turks.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the meantime, other Byzantine forces restored much of Southern Italy, lost over the previous 150 years, to the empire's control. When Basil finally died on December 15, 1025, he was planning a military expedition to recover the island of Sicily.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Basil II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Byzantine Emperor[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]958-1025[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Basil was the son of Emperor Romanos II by Theophano, whose family was of Armenian descent. In 960, he was associated on the throne by his father, but the latter died in 963, when Basil was only five years old. Because he and his brother, the future Emperor Constantine VIII (ruled 1025-1028), were too young to reign in their own right, Basil's mother Theophano married one of Romanos' leading generals, who took the throne as the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas several months later in 963. Nikephoros was murdered in 969, only to be succeeded by another general, who became Emperor John I Tzimisces and reigned for seven years. Finally, when John died on January 10, 976, Basil II took the throne as senior emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil was a brave soldier and a superb horseman; he was to prove himself a strong ruler and an able general. He did not at first display the full extent of his energy. In the early years of his reign, the administration remained in the hands of the eunuch Basil Lekapenos (an illegitimate son of Emperor Romanos I), president of the senate, a wily and gifted man, who hoped that the young emperors would be his puppet. Basil waited and watched without interfering, and devoted himself to learning the details of administrative business and instructing himself in military science.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Nikephoros II Phokas in particular had proven to be a brilliant military commander during his reign, both he and John I Tzimiskes had proven to be lax administrators. Although John had reportedly planned to curb the power of the landowners at the end of his reign, his death soon after speaking out against them led to his reported poisoning. As a result, Basil found himself with a serious problem as soon as his reign began. The great landowners of Asia Minor, Bardas Skleros and Bardas Phokas - who provided many of the empire's soldiers and taxes - were in open revolt against the empire. Basil, showing the penchant for ruthlessness that would become his trademark, took the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989).[PARAGRAPH:2]Having put an end to the internal strife, Basil II then turned his attention to the empire's other enemies. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the empire's position in the east and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch threatened by the enemy. In the 995, Basil II with an army of 40,000 men (with 80,000 mules), launched a campaign against the Muslim Arabs and won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south, sacking all of the cities from Emesa to Tripoli. Although he did not have sufficient forces to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire. No emperor since Heraclius had been able to hold these lands for any length of time, and they would remain Byzantine for the next 75 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil also wanted to restore to the empire territories that it had long lost. At the start of the second millennium, he took on his greatest adversary, Samuil of Bulgaria, who also was of Armenian descent. Bulgaria had been partly subjugated by John I Tzimiskes, but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control, under the leadership of Samuil and his brothers. As they raided Byzantine lands starting from 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissention by first allowing the escape of the captive emperor Boris II of Bulgaria. This having failed, Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead an army of 60,000 men into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets (Sofia) in 986. Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and headed back for Thrace but fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at Trajan's Gate at the Battle of Trayanovi Vrata.[PARAGRAPH:2]Basil escaped with the help of his Varangian Guard and attempted to make up his losses by turning Samuil's brother Aron against him.

A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomysl, a grandchild of Lestek, the father of Boleslaw I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland), the likely father of Sigrid the Haughty (a Nordic Queen) and the grandfather of Cnut the Great (Sigrid's son).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first historical ruler of Poland, Mieszko I is considered the de facto creator of the Polish state. He continued the policy of both his father and grandfather, who were rulers of the pagan tribes located in the area of present Greater Poland. Either through alliances or by use of military force, Mieszko extended the ongoing conquests and early in his reign subordinated Kuyavia and probably Gdansk Pomerania and Masovia. For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the control of Western Pomerania, eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower Oder. During the last years of his life he fought the Bohemian state, winning Silesia and probably Lesser Poland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mieszko I's marriage in 965 to the Czech Premyslid princess Dobrawa and his baptism in 966 put him and his country in the cultural sphere of Western Christianity. Apart from the great conquests accomplished during his reign (which proved to be fundamental for the future of Poland), Mieszko I was renowned for his internal reforms, aimed at expanding and improving the so-called war monarchy system.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to existing sources, Mieszko I was a wise politician, a talented military leader and charismatic ruler. He successfully used diplomacy, concluding an alliance with Bohemia first, and then with Sweden and the Holy Roman Empire. In foreign policy, he placed the interests of his country foremost, even entering into agreements with former enemies. On his death, he left to his sons a country of greatly expanded territory, with a well-established position in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mieszko I also enigmatically appeared as "Dagome" in a papal document dating to about 1085, called Dagome iudex, which mentions a gift or dedication of Mieszko's land to the Pope (the act took place almost a hundred years earlier).</English>

His predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks but from 1190 onward Philip styled himself king of France. The son of Louis VII and of his third wife, Adela of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed "God-given" because he was the first son of Louis VII and born late in his father's life.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a twelve year struggle with the Plantagenet dynasty, Philip broke up the large Angevin Empire and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English king was forced by his barons to sign the Magna Carta and faced a rebellion in which Philip intervened, the First Barons' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip did not directly participate in the Albigensian Crusade, but he allowed his vassals and knights to carry it out, preparing the subsequent expansion of France southward.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip was nicknamed "Augustus" by the chronicler Rigord for having remarkably extended the royal demesne, the domains ruled directly by the kings of France, as opposed to the territories ruled indirectly by vassals of the king.[PARAGRAPH:2]He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns to free themselves from seigniorial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent Bourgeoisie. He built a great wall around Paris, reorganized the government and brought financial stability to the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip Augustus transformed France from a small feudal state into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He died in 1223 and was succeeded by his son, Louis VIII. Knowing his own declining health would inevitably decrease his political strength, he was the first Capetian king not to have his eldest son anointed to act as co-ruler during his lifetime; instead his son acted as sole king.</English>

A city and a region of the country bear his name. His image is prominently displayed on Ukrainian banknotes and his monument in the centre of Kiev is the focal point of the Ukrainian capital. There have also been several issues of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, one of the highest decorations in Ukraine and in the former Soviet Union. With all this positive appreciation of his legacy, even in Ukraine it is far from being unanimous. He is mostly criticised for his union with Russia, which - in the view of some - proved to be disastrous for the future of the country. This particular view, among others, was expressed by a prominent Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko, who was one of Khmelnytsky's very vocal and harsh critics. Furthermore his local reputation was damaged by his alliance with the Crimean Tatars, which permitted the latter to take a large number of Ukrainian peasants as slaves (this may be interpreted as an illustration of the relative indifference of the cossacks as a military caste toward the 'kholopy', the lowest stratum of the Ukrainian people). The traces of this are still found in folk songs. On the balance, the view of his legacy in present-day Ukraine is more positive than negative, with some critics admitting that the union with Russia was dictated by necessity and an attempt to survive in those difficult times.[PARAGRAPH:2]In their assessment of Khmelnytsky's legacy the official Russian historiography stressed the fact that Khmelnytsky entered into union with Moscow's Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich with an expressed desire to "re-unify" Ukraine with Russia. This view corresponded with the official theory of Moscow being an heir of the Kievan Rus' and thus a gatherer of its former territories. In this light Khmelnytsky was viewed as a national hero of Russia for bringing Ukraine into the "eternal union" of all the Russias - Great, Little and White Russia. As such, he was much respected and venerated in Imperial Russia. His role was presented as a model for all Ukrainians to follow, &#151;to aspire for closer ties with Great Russia. This view was expressed in a monument commissioned by the Russian nationalist Mikhail Yuzefovich, which was installed in the center of Kiev in 1888. The original variant of the monument (created by Russian sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin) appeared too xenophobic for the Russian authorities, as it was to depict a vanquished Pole, Jew, and a Catholic priest under the hoofs of the horse. A more moderate version was installed, but the inscription on the monument read "To Bohdan Khmelnitsky from one and indivisible Russia." The view of Khmelnytsky as a prominent, positive figure in the Russian history is further displayed in Mikeshin's Monument to the Millennium of Russia in Novgorod, where Khmelnytsky is shown as one of Russia's prominent figures. Soviet historiography followed in many ways the Imperial Russian theory of re-unification while adding the class struggle dimension to the story. Thus, Khmelnytsky was not only praised for re-unifying Ukraine with Russia, but also for organizing the class struggle of oppressed Ukrainian peasants against Polish exploiters.</English>

The oldest son of Henry I the Fowler and Matilda, Otto was "the first of the Germans to be called the emperor of Italy".[PARAGRAPH:2]Otto inherited the Duchy of Saxony and the kingship of the Germans upon his father's death in 936. He continued his father's work of unifying all German tribes into a single kingdom and greatly expanded the king's powers at the expense of the aristocracy. Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, Otto installed members of his family in the kingdom's most important duchies. This reduced the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, to royal subjects under his authority. Otto transformed the Roman Catholic Church in Germany to strengthen the royal office and subjected its clergy to his personal control.[PARAGRAPH:2]After putting down a brief civil war among the rebellious duchies, Otto defeated the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, thus ending the Hungarian invasions of Western Europe. The victory against the pagan Magyars earned Otto a reputation as a savior of Christendom and secured his hold over the kingdom. By 961, Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy and extended his realm's borders to the north, east, and south. The patronage of Otto and his immediate successors facilitated a limited cultural renaissance of the arts and architecture. Following the example of Charlemagne's coronation as "Emperor of the Romans" in 800, Otto was crowned Emperor in 962 by Pope John XII in Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]Otto's later years were marked by conflicts with the Papacy and struggles to stabilize his rule over Italy. Reigning from Rome, Otto sought to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire, which opposed his claim to emperorship and his realm's further expansion to the south. To resolve this conflict, the Byzantine princess Theophanu married his son, Otto II, in April 972. Otto finally returned to Germany in August 972 and died at Memleben in 973. Otto II succeeded him as Emperor.</English>

The expedition was a private undertaking. He and Primo initially marched south towards Ascalon, but an Egyptian army forced them to march inland towards the Siege of Jerusalem, then in progress. The lumber from their dismantled ships was converted into siege towers which were instrumental in the successful taking of the city on 15 July. It was there that Embriaco earned his sobriquet Caputmallei or Testadimaglio, meaning &#34;mallet head&#34;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Embriaco assisted in the capture of Jaffa and then, with 200 to 300 men, at the Battle of Ascalon on 12 August, where he commanded a naval contingent offshore.

He embarked, carrying the new papal legate, the cardinal-bishop of Ostia, on 1 August 1100.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his second arrival in the Holy Land, he met King Baldwin I at Laodicea and together they planned a campaign against for the next spring. At Laodicea, he wintered and fought many skirmishes with the Saracen corsairs. In March 1101, he set out from Laodicea, evading a large Egyptian fleet near Haifa, and landed at Jaffa on Easter Monday. He accompanied Baldwin from there to Jerusalem to celebrate Easter and visit the River Jordan. The Genoese were promised a third of the booty of the campaign and they set out for Arsuf, which fell after three days on 9 May. Caesarea held out until 17 May. A thousand Arab merchants who had taken refuge in the mosque paid the Genoese for their release and safety.[PARAGRAPH:2]In July, Embriaco returned to Genoa after making a treaty with Tancred, Prince of Galilee.

The expedition was a private undertaking. He and Primo initially marched south towards Ascalon, but an Egyptian army forced them to march inland towards the Siege of Jerusalem, then in progress. The lumber from their dismantled ships was converted into siege towers which were instrumental in the successful taking of the city on 15 July. It was there that Embriaco earned his sobriquet Caputmallei or Testadimaglio, meaning &#34;mallet head&#34;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Embriaco assisted in the capture of Jaffa and then, with 200 to 300 men, at the Battle of Ascalon on 12 August, where he commanded a naval contingent offshore. Embriaco and his brother returned to Genoa with letters from Godfrey of Bouillon and Daimbert of Pisa, the Defender of the Holy Sepulchre and Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem respectively, describing the success of the Crusaders and the urgent need of reinforcements. They arrived in Genoa on 24 December. Embriaco was granted the title of consul exercitus Ianuensium - &#34;consul of the Genoese army&#34; - by the Compagna and sent back with a fleet of twenty six or seven galleys, four to six cargo ships, and three to four thousand men. He embarked, carrying the new papal legate, the cardinal-bishop of Ostia, on 1 August 1100.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his second arrival in the Holy Land, he met King Baldwin I at Laodicea and together they planned a campaign against for the next spring. At Laodicea, he wintered and fought many skirmishes with the Saracen corsairs. In March 1101, he set out from Laodicea, evading a large Egyptian fleet near Haifa, and landed at Jaffa on Easter Monday. He accompanied Baldwin from there to Jerusalem to celebrate Easter and visit the River Jordan. The Genoese were promised a third of the booty of the campaign and they set out for Arsuf, which fell after three days on 9 May. Caesarea held out until 17 May. A thousand Arab merchants who had taken refuge in the mosque paid the Genoese for their release and safety.[PARAGRAPH:2]In July, Embriaco returned to Genoa after making a treaty with Tancred, Prince of Galilee.

Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led Scotland during the Wars of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent nation and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero.[PARAGRAPH:2]Descended from the Anglo-Norman and Gaelic nobilities, his paternal fourth-great grandfather was David I. Robert's grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the "Great Cause". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. In 1298, Bruce became a Guardian of Scotland alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne, John Comyn, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due in part to his quarrels with Comyn but chiefly because the restoration of King John seemed imminent. In 1302, he submitted to Edward I and returned to "the king's peace". When his father died in 1304, Bruce inherited his family's claim to the throne. In February 1306, following an argument during a meeting at Greyfriars monastery, Dumfries, Bruce killed Comyn. He was excommunicated by the Pope but absolved by Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306, at Scone. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, and Bruce was forced to flee into hiding in the Hebrides and Ireland before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Bruce defeated the Comyns and his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands from Buchan to Galloway. In 1309, he held his first parliament at St Andrews, and a series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland. At the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314, Bruce defeated a much larger English army under Edward II, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish monarchy. The battle marked a significant turning point, and, freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England; Bruce launched devastating raids into Lancashire and Yorkshire. He also decided to expand his war against the English and create a second front by sending an army under his younger brother, Edward, to invade Ireland, appealing to the native Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to give up his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish magnates and nobles submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Bruce as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Bruce as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was temporarily concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Robert I died on 7 June 1329. His body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey. Bruce's lieutenant and friend Sir James Douglas agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the Lord's Sepulchre in the Holy Land, but he only reached Moorish Granada. Douglas was killed in battle during the siege of Teba while fulfilling his promise. His body and the casket containing the embalmed heart were found upon the field.

According to legend and historical tradition, Marfa led the republic's struggle against Muscovy between her husband's death and the city's eventual annexation by Ivan III of Russia in 1478.[PARAGRAPH:2]While she is referred to as Mayoress, this was in no way a formal office. She may have been the focal point of the anti-Muscovite faction and had considerable charisma or influence as the matriarch of the clan, but never held actual office in Novgorod as they were confined to the male land-owners.[PARAGRAPH:2]Marfa was widowed in the 1460s but remained one of the wealthiest individuals in Novgorod who owned sizable estates. Peasants on her lands to the north of Novgorod engaged in fishing, fur hunting, livestock raising, and salt boiling. Her southern estates produced edible grains and flax.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the middle of the fifteenth century, the relations between the principalities of Moscow and Novgorod, long strained by chronic disputes over trade, taxes, and legal jurisdiction, intensified into overt hostilities. In 1471 Marfa and her sons, Dmitrii and Fedor (as the last representatives of the anti-Muscovite Boretsky family), and a party of loyal Novgorodian boyars, attempted to negotiate with Casimir IV Jagiellon the terms of the city's handover to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, provided that the city's ancient privileges and rights will be retained.[PARAGRAPH:2]On hearing about Marfa's manoeuvres, Ivan III advanced against Novgorod and defeated the Novgorodian volunteer army in the decisive Battle of Shelon (July 14, 1471). Marfa's son Dmitrii, who served as mayor during 1470 and 1471, was executed on July 24, 1471 at the behest of the grand prince. Her other son Fedor has also been identified with the pro-Lithuanian faction in Novgorod. The evidence for his activity is ambiguous, nevertheless he was arrested in 1476 and exiled to Murom, where he died that same year.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although she continued to rely on Lithuania's support and intrigue against Moscow, Ivan III finally subjugated Novgorod in 1478. He ordered that Muscovite governors be introduced into Novgorod and that the landowning elite be evicted and resettled. Marfa and her grandsons were taken into custody and escorted to Moscow (February 7, 1478), all her lands were confiscated. According to tradition, Marfa was forced to take the veil in Nizhny Novgorod, the date and circumstances of her death are uncertain.</English>

His long reign saw the expansion of the House of Arag&#243;n on all sides: into Valencia to the south, Languedoc to the north, and the Balearic Islands to the east. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the Spanish kings. James compiled the Llibre del Consulat de Mar, which governed maritime trade and helped establish Catalan supremacy in the western Mediterranean.

He is generally regarded as the most successful of the Stewart monarchs of Scotland, but his reign ended with the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Flodden Field, where he became the last monarch from not only Scotland, but also from all of Great Britain, to be killed in battle.[PARAGRAPH:2]In May 1493 John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, was forfeited by the Parliament of Scotland. King James himself sailed to Dunstaffnage Castle, where the western chiefs made their submission to him. John surrendered and was brought back as a pensioner to the royal court, then lived at Paisley Abbey. The Highlands and Islands now fell to direct royal control. John's grandson Domhnall Dubh (Donald Owre), one of the possible claimants to the Lordship was peaceable, but the other, his nephew Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh invaded Ross and was later killed on the island of Oronsay in 1497.[PARAGRAPH:2]In October 1496 the Royal Council ordered that the Clan Chiefs in the region would be held responsible by the king for crimes of the islanders. This act for the governance of the region was unworkable, and after the Act of Revocation of 1498 undermined the Chief's titles to their lands, resistance to Edinburgh rule was strengthened. James waited at Kilkerran Castle at Campbeltown Loch to re-grant the Chief's charters in the summer of 1498. Few of the Chiefs turned up. At first, Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll, was set to fill the power vacuum and enforce royal authority, but he met with limited success in a struggle with his brother-in-law, Torquil MacLeod of Lewis. Torquil was ordered to hand over Donald Dubh, heir to the lordship of the Isles, to James IV at Inverness in 1501. James waited, but Torquil never came.[PARAGRAPH:2]After this defiance, Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly, was granted Torquil's lands. He raised an army in Lochaber and also cleared the tenants of that area, replacing them with his supporters. After the parliament of 1504, a royal fleet sailed north from Ayr to attack the Castle of Cairn-na-Burgh, west of Mull, where, it is thought, Maclean of Duart had Donald Dubh in his keeping. As progress at the siege was slow, James sent Hans the royal gunner in Robert Barton's ship and then the Earl of Arran with provisions and more artillery. Cairn-na-Burgh was captured by June 1504 but Donald Dubh remained at liberty. In September 1507, Torquil MacLeod was besieged at Stornoway Castle on Lewis. Donald Dubh was captured and kept in prison for the rest of life, and Torquil MacLeod died in exile in 1511. The Earl of Huntly was richly rewarded for his troubles, a price that James was prepared to pay.</English>

		<English>[H1]John II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Aragon[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] September 24, 1625 - Augustus 20, 1672[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]John II the Faithless (Catalan: Joan II el Sense Fe), also known as the Great (29 June 1398 - 20 January 1479) was the King of Aragon from 1458 until 1479, and jure uxoris King of Navarre from 1425 until his death. He was the son of Ferdinand I and his wife Eleanor of Alburquerque. John is regarded as one of the most memorable kings of the 15th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]John was born at Medina del Campo. In his youth he was one of the infantes (princes) of Aragon who took part in the dissensions of Castile during the minority and reign of John II. Till middle life he was also lieutenant-general in Aragon for his brother and predecessor Alfonso V, whose reign was mainly spent in Italy. In his old age he was engaged in incessant conflicts with his Aragonese and Catalan subjects, with Louis XI of France, and in preparing the way for the marriage of his son Ferdinand with Isabella I of Castile which brought about the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile and which was to create the Kingdom of Spain. His troubles with his subjects were closely connected with tragic dissensions within his own family.[PARAGRAPH:2]John was first married to Blanche I of Navarre of the house of &#201;vreux. By right of Blanche he became king of Navarre, and on her death in 1441 he was left in possession of the kingdom for his lifetime. But one son, Charles, given the title &#34;Prince of Viana&#34; as heir of Navarre, had been born of the marriage. John quickly came to regard this son with jealousy. After his second marriage, to Juana Enr&#237;quez, it grew into absolute hatred, being encouraged by Juana. John tried to deprive his son of his constitutional right to act as lieutenant-general of Aragon during his father&#39;s absence. Charles&#39;s cause was taken up by the Aragonese, however, and the king&#39;s attempt to make his second wife lieutenant-general was set aside.[PARAGRAPH:2]There followed the long Navarrese Civil War, with alternations of success and defeat, ending only with the death of the prince of Viana, perhaps by poison administered by his stepmother in 1461. The Catalans, who had adopted the cause of Charles and who had grievances of their own, called in a succession of foreign pretenders in a War against John II. His last years John spent contending with these. He was forced to pawn Roussillon, his possession on the north-east of the Pyrenees, to King Louis XI of France, who refused to part with it.[PARAGRAPH:2]In his old age John was blinded by cataracts, but recovered his eyesight by the operation of couching conducted by his physician Abiathar Crescas, a Jew. The Catalan revolt was pacified in 1472, but John carried on a war, in which he was generally unfortunate, with his neighbor the French king till his death in 1479. He was succeeded by Ferdinand, his son by his second marriage, who was already married to Isabella I of Castile. With his death and son&#39;s accession to the throne of Aragon, the unification of Spain under one royal house began in earnest.</English>
