		<English>[TAB]While the current St. Peter's Basilica is relatively new, that's not the first home of the Pope (and the heart of the Catholic Church) in Vatican City, Italy. Old St. Peter's Basilica was the building that stood, from the 4th to 16th centuries, where the new St. Peter's Basilica stands today. Construction of the basilica, built over the historical site of the Circus of Nero, began during the reign of Emperor Constantine I. The name "old St. Peter's Basilica" has been used since the construction of the current basilica to distinguish the two buildings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Construction began by orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I between 318 and 322, and took about 40 years to complete. Over the next twelve centuries, the church gradually gained importance, eventually becoming a major place of pilgrimage in Rome. Papal coronations were held at the basilica, and in 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire there.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the 15th century the church was falling into ruin. Discussions on repairing parts of the structure commenced upon the pope's return from Avignon. Two people involved in this reconstruction were Leon Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino, who improved the apse and partially added a multi-story benediction loggia to the atrium facade, on which construction continued intermittently until the new basilica was begun.[PARAGRAPH:2]The current St. Peter's Basilica, having only been occupied by the Pope since the breakup of the Papal State in 1871, is a relatively new addition to the Church's assets. Sitting adjacent to the iconic St. Peter's Square, the Palace acts as the administrative center for all business of the Catholic Church. Further, it is from here that the Pope issues decrees which affect Catholics throughout the world. And with nearly one in six people on Earth prescribing to Catholicism, this means the St. Peter's Basilica is the headquarters for one of the most influential organizations on the planet.[PARAGRAPH:2]While the palace's importance as a world administrative center cannot be doubted, the St. Peter's Basilica also houses one of the most famous art collections on Earth.

		<English>[TAB]The Hagia Sophia, or "Church of the Holy Wisdom," was constructed in 530 AD as a Greek Orthodox church. Standing in Istanbul (originally Constantinople), Turkey, it is a beautiful and ornate structure, built of stone and marble, and topped by a golden dome measuring over 100 feet in diameter. An extremely difficult engineering challenge for the time, the dome has collapsed several times during its existence. Four graceful towers stand at the corners of the building.[PARAGRAPH:2]The interior of the Hagia Sophia is a marvelous space of columns and arches extending up to the dome, which appears almost to float atop the building. The interior was sheathed in colored marble and golden mosaics depicting biblical scenes and images of Christian saints.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1453 Constantinople was captured by the Ottoman Turks, and the Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque. Human images are not welcome in mosques, and many of the mosaics were covered with plaster.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1934, Turkish President Kemal Ataturk turned the building into a museum. In recent years some restoration work has been done on the Hagia Sophia, and a few of the mosaics have been uncovered. Despite the ravages of time, the Hagia Sophia remains universally acknowledged as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world.</English>

It is considered the fourth-holiest place in Islam.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Arab conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica, which was dedicated to John the Baptist (Yahya) since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine I. The mosque holds a shrine which today may still contain the head of John the Baptist, honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims alike. There are also many important landmarks within the mosque for the Shi'ah, among them the place where the head of Husayn (the grandson of Muhammad) was kept on display by Yazid I. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Damascus was captured and besieged by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. Decades later, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I, then commissioned the construction of a mosque on the site of the Byzantine cathedral in 706. Prior to this, the cathedral was still in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims had been constructed on the southeastern part of the building. Al-Walid, who personally supervised the project, had most of the cathedral including the musalla demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building. The new house of worship was meant to serve as a large congregational mosque for the citizens of Damascus and as a tribute to the city. Because of Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered the all other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 715 by the caliph, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, shortly after the death of al-Walid that same year.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 dinars were spent on the project. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the work force which consisted of 12,000 people. Ibn al-Faqih also relays the story that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of St. John the Baptist, or Yahya ibn Zakariya in Islam. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.</English>

Because of Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered the all other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 715 by the caliph, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, shortly after the death of al-Walid that same year.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 dinars were spent on the project. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the work force which consisted of 12,000 people. Ibn al-Faqih also relays the story that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of St. John the Baptist, or Yahya ibn Zakariya in Islam. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (it was formerly the Basilica of Saint John the Baptist), is located in the old city of Damascus, and is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. It is considered the fourth-holiest place in Islam.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Arab conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica, which was dedicated to John the Baptist (Yahya) since the time of the Roman emperor Constantine I. The mosque holds a shrine which today may still contain the head of John the Baptist, honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims alike. There are also many important landmarks within the mosque for the Shi'ah, among them the place where the head of Husayn (the grandson of Muhammad) was kept on display by Yazid I. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Damascus was captured and besieged by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. Decades later, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I, then commissioned the construction of a mosque on the site of the Byzantine cathedral in 706. Prior to this, the cathedral was still in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims had been constructed on the southeastern part of the building. Al-Walid, who personally supervised the project, had most of the cathedral including the musalla demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building. The new house of worship was meant to serve as a large congregational mosque for the citizens of Damascus and as a tribute to the city.

		<German>[TAB]Der Tempelberg ist ein H&#252;gel im S&#252;dostteil der Jerusalemer Altstadt, oberhalb des Kidrontales. An seinem Gipfel befindet sich ein k&#252;nstliches Plateau. Urspr&#252;nglich standen hier der Salomonische Tempel und der nachfolgende Herodianische Tempel. Heute befinden sich dort der Felsendom und die al-Aq&#x1E63;&#x101;-Moschee. Der Tempelberg ist einer der umstrittensten heiligen Orte der Welt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vor 3000 Jahren errichteten der Bibel zufolge die Israeliten unter Salomo den ersten Tempel &#x2013; Baubeginn 957 v. Chr. &#x2013; an dieser Stelle. An diesem Ort im Tempel befand sich das Hauptheiligtum des Judentums, das als Mishkan (hebr&#228;isch &#x5DE;&#x5E9;&#x5DB;&#x5DF; &#x201E;Gottes Heimst&#228;tte auf Erden&#x201C;), als &#x201E;Tabernakel&#x201C; oder im Deutsch der Lutherbibel auch als &#x201E;Stiftsh&#252;tte&#x201C; bekannt ist. Im besonders heiligen, abgegrenzten Bereich dieses Allerheiligsten im Tempel wurde die Bundeslade aufbewahrt. Das Allerheiligste durfte nur einmal j&#228;hrlich durch den Hohepriester betreten werden. Es war ein Symbol f&#252;r das eigentliche Heiligtum, im Himmel, Gott. Der Tempel war das Zentrum des israelitischen Gottesdienstes. Als Nebukadnezar II. Jerusalem eroberte, lie&#223; er den Tempel 586 v. Chr. zerst&#246;ren. Nach ihrer R&#252;ckkehr aus dem Babylonischen Exil errichteten die Juden an derselben Stelle den zweiten Tempel (Fertigstellung 516 v. Chr.). Von Herodes dem Gro&#223;en monumental ausgebaut, wurde der Tempel im j&#252;disch-r&#246;mischen Krieg im Jahre 70 n. Chr. durch die R&#246;mer zerst&#246;rt. Die Zerst&#246;rungen beider Tempel im Abstand von 655 Jahren, die nach der j&#252;dischen &#220;berlieferung beide am 9. Aw stattfanden, bilden zentrale Punkte in der j&#252;dischen Geschichte. Der erhoffte Wiederaufbau des Tempels in Jerusalem und das ersehnte Anbrechen der Messianischen Zeiten ist zentrales Anliegen zahlreicher j&#252;discher Gebete, so des Achtzehnbittengebetes. Die Westmauer oder Klagemauer ist ein &#220;berrest der Mauern, die das urspr&#252;ngliche, k&#252;nstlich erweiterte Tempelplateau st&#252;tzen. Viele Juden gestalten dort Gebete und viele Menschen hinterlassen Gebetszettel in den Mauerspalten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach der Zerst&#246;rung des zweiten Tempels und der Vertreibung der j&#252;dischen Bev&#246;lkerung aus Jerusalem entstand auf dem Tempelberg zun&#228;chst ein r&#246;mischer Jupiter-Tempel, sp&#228;ter eine christliche Kirche.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Islam gilt der Tempelberg als die drittheiligste St&#228;tte nach Mekka und Medina. Von hier soll der Prophet Mohammed seine Nachtreise (Sure 17, Vers 1) zu der &#x201E;entferntesten Moschee&#x201C; unternommen haben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Tempelberg ist der Ort des ehemaligen Allerheiligsten des Judentums. Es war ein Symbol f&#252;r das eigentliche Heiligtum, f&#252;r Gott. Heute sind als symbolische Entsprechung die Bereiche in Synagogen, in denen die Gebete von den Gemeinden gestaltet werden, die Hauptheiligt&#252;mer im Judentum.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Kazimierz is a historical district of Krak&#243;w (Poland), best known for being home to a Jewish community from the 14th century until the Second World War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jews had played an important role in the Krak&#243;w region economy since the end thirteenth century. The Jewish community in Krak&#243;w had lived undisturbed alongside their Christian neighbours under the protective King Kazimierz III. By the reign of King Jogaila (reigned in Poland 1386-1434), however, relations had deteriorated and pogroms began to occur with increasing frequency. As part of the re-founding of the Cracow Academy, starting in 1400, the Academy began to buy out buildings in the old Jewish district. The Jewish community moved to the area around modern Plac Szczepanski. During the last decade of the fifteenth century anti-Semitism led many Jews to move out of Krak&#243;w to nearby Kazimierz. There, they built a Fortress synagogue, the Old Synagogue (Krak&#243;w). In 1494 a disastrous fire destroyed a large part of Krak&#243;w. Raging populace soon attacked the Jews, blaming the fire on them. In 1495 the Polish king John I Albert of Poland expelled all Jews from Krak&#243;w, resettling them to the old Baw&#243;l district of Kazimierz. For its own defence against Christian raids, the kahal petitioned the Kazimierz town council for the right to build its own interior wall, cutting across the western end of the older defensive walls in 1553. Due to the growth of the community, the walls were expanded again in 1608. Later requests to expand the walls were turned down.[PARAGRAPH:2]The area between the walls was known as the Oppidum Judaeorum, the Jewish City, which represented only about one fifth of the geographical area of Kazimierz, but nearly half of its inhabitants. The Oppidum became the main spiritual and cultural centre of Polish Jewry, hosting many of Poland's finest Jewish scholars, artists and craftsmen. Among its famous inhabitants were the Talmudist Moses Isserles, the Kabbalist Natan Szpiro, and the royal physician Shmuel bar Meshulam.[PARAGRAPH:2]Interior of the Old Synagogue of Kazimierz before 1939.The golden age of the Oppidum came to an end in 1782, when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II disbanded the kahal. In 1822, the walls were torn down, removing any physical reminder of the old borders between Jewish and Christian Kazimierz.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1791, Kazimierz lost its status as a separate city and became a district of Krak&#243;w. The richer Jewish families quickly moved out of the overcrowded streets of eastern Kazimierz. Because of the injunction against travel on the Sabbath, however, most Jewish families stayed relatively close to the historic synagogues in the old Oppidum, maintaining Kazimierz's reputation as a "Jewish district" long after the concept ceased to have any administrative meaning. By the 1930s, Krak&#243;w had 120 officially registered synagogues and prayer houses scattered across the city and much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like Podg&#243;rze.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jewish children in front of Corpus Christi church sometime before 1939.In a tourist guide published in 1935, Meir Balaban, a Reform rabbi and professor of History at the University of Warsaw, lamented that the Jews who remained in the once vibrant Oppidum were "only the poor and the ultra-conservative." However, this same exodus was the reason why most of the buildings in the Oppidum are preserved today in something close to their 18th century shape.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Second World War, the Jews of Krakow, including those in Kazimierz, were forced by the Nazis into a crowded ghetto in Podg&#243;rze, across the river.

		<German>[TAB]Die Stadt Kazimierz wurde 1335 von K&#246;nig Kasimir dem Gro&#223;en gegr&#252;ndet und nach seinem Vornamen Kazimierz benannt. Die Stadt erhielt Wehranlagen und drei Kirchen, die gotische Katharinenkirche, die ebenfalls gotische Fronleichnamskirche sowie die barocke Klosterkirche Skalka, welche an Stelle eines alten heidnischen Heiligtums gebaut wurde und die zur Station der Pilgerz&#252;ge vor der K&#246;nigskr&#246;nung wurde.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unter Kasimir Jagiello wurde die Fronleichnamskirche den lateranischen Kanonikern &#252;bergeben, in deren Besitz sie sich noch immer befindet. In den Pogromen von 1494 wurden Juden aus Krakau vertrieben und siedelten sich hier an; es entstand ein j&#252;disches Viertel, die Judenstadt mit ihrem unverwechselbaren, vom j&#252;dischen Leben gepr&#228;gten Stadtbild. Mehrere Synagogen entstanden, darunter die von Rabbi Moses Isserles (1525-1572) erbaute Remu-Synagoge, sowie der j&#252;dische Friedhof aus dem Jahre 1551.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Zuge der Ersten Teilung Polens wurde Kazimierz von der &#246;sterreichischen Armee besetzt und in die &#246;sterreichische Verwaltung eingegliedert. Erst ein paar Jahre sp&#228;ter wurde es an Polen zur&#252;ckgegeben. Als 1846 die Republik Krakau vom Kaisertum &#214;sterreich annektiert wurde, wurde Kazimierz Teil des Gro&#223;herzogtums Krakau und damit &#214;sterreichs. Im Jahre 1867 wurde Kazimierz nach Krakau eingemeindet.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die j&#252;dische Gemeinde von Kazimierz wurde w&#228;hrend der deutschen Besetzung zun&#228;chst in das Ghetto Krakau in Podg&#243;rze umgesiedelt; die Mitglieder der Gemeinde wurden in der Folge fast alle ermordet. Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges verkam Kazimierz zum verrufensten Stadtteil Krakaus und verfiel zu gro&#223;en Teilen. Erst durch den Film Schindlers Liste, dessen Handlung teilweise in Kazimierz gedreht wurde, obwohl sich das Ghetto in Podg&#243;rze auf der anderen Seite der Weichsel befand, erwachte der Stadtteil zu neuem Leben. Inzwischen sind viele der Geb&#228;ude saniert worden, und in die ehemalige Judenstadt zogen wieder Gesch&#228;fte und Restaurants ein. Kazimierz wird heute von vielen Besuchern Krakaus aufgesucht.</German>

Most of them were later killed during the liquidation of the ghetto or in death camps.</Spanish>

		<German>[TAB]Der Stephansdom (eigentlich: Domkirche St. Stephan zu Wien) am Wiener Stephansplatz (Bezirk Innere Stadt) ist seit 1365 Domkirche (Sitz eines Domkapitels), seit 1469/1479 Kathedrale (Bischofssitz) und seit 1723 Metropolitankirche des Erzbischofs von Wien. Der von Wienern mitunter auch kurz Steffl genannte r&#246;misch-katholische Dom gilt als Wahrzeichen Wiens und wird h&#228;ufig auch als &#246;sterreichisches Nationalheiligtum bezeichnet. Namensgeber ist der heilige Stephanus, der als erster christlicher M&#228;rtyrer gilt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Bauwerk ist 107 Meter lang und 34 Meter breit. Der Dom ist eines der wichtigsten gotischen Bauwerke in &#214;sterreich. Teile des sp&#228;tromanischen Vorg&#228;ngerbaues von 1230/40 bis 1263 sind noch erhalten und bilden die Westfassade, flankiert von den beiden Heident&#252;rmen, die etwa 65 Meter hoch sind. Insgesamt besitzt der Stephansdom vier T&#252;rme: Der h&#246;chste ist der S&#252;dturm mit 136,4 Meter, der Nordturm wurde nicht fertiggestellt und ist nur 68 Meter hoch. Im ehemaligen &#214;sterreich-Ungarn durfte keine Kirche h&#246;her als der S&#252;dturm des Stephansdoms erbaut werden. So wurde beispielsweise der Maria-Empf&#228;ngnis-Dom in Linz um zwei Meter niedriger gebaut.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der S&#252;dturm ist ein architektonisches Meisterwerk der damaligen Zeit; trotz seiner bemerkenswerten H&#246;he ist das Fundament weniger als 4 Meter tief. Im S&#252;dturm befinden sich insgesamt 13 Glocken, wovon 11 das Hauptgel&#228;ut des Stephansdoms bilden. Die Pummerin, die zweitgr&#246;&#223;te freischwingend gel&#228;utete Kirchenglocke Europas, befindet sich im Nordturm unter einer Turmhaube aus der Renaissance-Zeit.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Krak des Chevaliers ("fortress of the knights" in a mixture of Arabic and French) was the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller in Syria during the Crusades. The castle is located east of Tripoli in the Homs Gap, atop a 650-meter high hill along the only route from Antioch to Beirut and the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of many fortresses part of a defensive network along the border of the old Crusader states.[PARAGRAPH:2]The original fortress had been built in 1031 for the emir of Aleppo. It was captured by Raymond IV of Toulouse early in 1099, during the First Crusade, but was abandoned when the Crusaders continued their march to Jerusalem. It was reoccupied again by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, in 1110. Raymond II, count of Tripoli, gave it to the Hospitallers in 1144. The Hospitallers rebuilt it and expanded it into the largest Crusader fortress in the Holy Land, adding an outer wall 3 meters thick with seven guard towers 8-10 meters thick, to create a concentric castle. One of these towers was occupied by the Grand Master of the Hospitallers. In the 12th century there was a moat covered by a drawbridge leading to postern gates.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1163, the fortress was unsuccessfully besieged by Nur ad-Din. After their victory the Hospitallers became an essentially independent force on the Tripolitanian frontier. By 1170, the Hospitallers' modifications were complete, but parts of the fortress were rebuilt after numerous earthquakes in the late 12th century and early 13th century. It is estimated that the castle fortress could hold 50-60 Hospitallers and up to 2,000 foot soldiers. Aside from the control of the road to the Mediterranean, the Hospitallers also exerted some influence over Lake Homs to the east, where they could control the fishing industry and watch for Muslim armies gathering in Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another failed siege was made by Saladin in 1188, during which the castle general was captured. He was taken by Saladin's men to the castle gates where he was told to order the gates opened. He first told his men in Arabic to surrender the castle, then in French told them to hold the castle to the last man. (Adapted from Wikipedia.org)</English>

By 1170, the Hospitallers' modifications were complete, but parts of the fortress were rebuilt after numerous earthquakes in the late 12th century and early 13th century. It is estimated that the castle fortress could hold 50-60 Hospitallers and up to 2,000 foot soldiers. Aside from the control of the road to the Mediterranean, the Hospitallers also exerted some influence over Lake Homs to the east, where they could control the fishing industry and watch for Muslim armies gathering in Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another failed siege was made by Saladin in 1188, during which the castle general was captured. He was taken by Saladin's men to the castle gates where he was told to order the gates opened. He first told his men in Arabic to surrender the castle, then in French told them to hold the castle to the last man. (Adapted from Wikipedia.org)</French>

Sie hatte den Namen Hisn al-Akrad (Kurden-Burg).[PARAGRAPH:2]1099 erreichte das Heer des Ersten Kreuzzugs unter Raimund von Saint-Gilles, das sich auf dem Weg nach Jerusalem befand, Hisn al-Akrad. Das Heer besetzte die Burg und hielt sich zehn Tage darin auf, bevor es weiterzog und die Stadt Arqa belagerte. Nachdem das Kreuzfahrerheer weitergezogen war, gelangte die Burg wieder in muslimischen Besitz.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wenige Jahre nach dem erfolgreichen Ende des Ersten Kreuzzugs kehrte Raimund von Toulouse in die Gegend zur&#252;ck und versuchte, sich eine eigene Herrschaft aufzubauen. W&#228;hrend er die Hafenstadt Tartus schon 1102 einnehmen konnte, leisteten Hisn al-Akrad und die Hafenstadt Tripolis erbitterten Widerstand. Nach Raimunds Tod 1105 setzte sein Sohn Bertrand von Saint-Gilles sein Vorhaben der Errichtung der Grafschaft Tripolis mit der Eroberung von Tripolis 1109 fort. Hisn al-Akrad wurde 1110 durch den normannischen Heerf&#252;hrer Tankred von Tiberias erobert, der in Konkurrenz zu den provencalischen Saint-Gilles' und ihrer Grafschaft Tripolis die Ausweitung der normannischen Herrschaft um das von seinem Onkel Bohemund von Tarent gegr&#252;ndeten F&#252;rstentum Antiochia verfolgte.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Krak des Chevaliers ("fortress of the knights" in a mixture of Arabic and French) was the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller in Syria during the Crusades.

It is one of many fortresses part of a defensive network along the border of the old Crusader states.[PARAGRAPH:2]The original fortress had been built in 1031 for the emir of Aleppo.

It was always green, and no one knew what species it was. There was also a well where they apparently used to perform the sacrifices. One of these was to immerse a living man in the well.

Inside the temple, which was richly decorated with gold, there were three statues of gods. The most important god, Thor sat on a throne in the centre and beside him sat the gods Odin (called Wotan by Adam) and Freyr (called Fricco by Adam). Thor was said to govern the air, thunder, lightning, winds, rain, good weather and harvests. Odin, which meant the furious, brought war and gave strength against enemies. Freyr who gave peace and pleasure was represented by a statue with an immense phallos. Odin's statue was armed, and was likened to Mars and Thor was likened by Adam to Jupiter. The people also worshiped heroes who had been elevated to gods, such as King Erik about whom it is told in Vita Ansgari.[PARAGRAPH:2]There were priests appointed for the gods, and if plague or famine threatened they sacrificed to Thor, whereas they sacrificed to Odin for war and to Freyr for marriages.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Preslav war von 893 bis 969 bulgarische Hauptstadt, die Siedlung diente zun&#228;chst als Milit&#228;rlager.

In fr&#252;heren Jahrhunderten umgab eine starke Festungsmauer die &#228;u&#223;ere Stadt, wo die "einfachen" Leute lebten und arbeiteten. Als &#220;berreste sind heute noch zwei Pforten der Au&#223;enstadt sowie ein, kleiner sieben Meter hoher Teil der Mauer erhalten geblieben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das bekannteste Geb&#228;ude der Stadt ist die "goldene" Kirche aus dem Jahr 908. Schon von weither ist die von au&#223;en vergoldete Kuppel des relativ kleinen Gotteshauses zu erkennen. Das zentrale Geb&#228;ude ist von 12 Nischen und 12 wei0en Marmors&#228;ulen gepr&#228;gt, mit den Mosaikverzierungen und Skulpturen stellt die goldene Kirche ein einzigartiges Denkmal altbulgarischer Architektur dar. Viele Wissenschaftler zog es in die alte Hauptstadt, erste Ausgrabungen begannen im Jahr 1987, Rekonstruktions-und Restaurationsarbeiten sind noch heute im Gange. Unter den Exponaten im arch&#228;ologischen Museum des Ortes ist zum Beispiel die Keramikikone von St. Teodor, sie wurde aus 20 gemalten Keramikplatten hergestellt und z&#228;hlt zu einem der Meisterwerke altbulgarischer Kunst. </German>
		<Italian>[TAB]The ancient Preslav (Bulgaria) came into being as a military camp with a fortified palace and a garrison during the first half of the 9th century in the time of Kan Omourtag (814-831).

It consists of a rotund, a narthex and an atrium. The rotund was covered by a semispherical gilt-plated dome, whereby its shape was additionally emphasized by 12 lean columns, surrounding it in a circle. Rising in the centre of the rotund was a marble pulpit. There used to be a wall in the centre of the atrium. The pieces of marble columns, capitals with stylized acanthus, parts of cornices, fine columns encrusted with multicoloured slabs, ceramic slabs, etc. come to show that the church had had an exclusively rich architectural decoration.

		<English>[TAB]Khalid ibn al-Walid (592-642) also known as Sayfu l-Lahi l-Maslul (or Sayfullah, the "Drawn Sword of God", "God's Drawn Sword" or simply "Sword of God"), was one of the most successful commanders in military history. He is noted for his military prowess, commanding the forces of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and those of his immediate successors of the Rashidun Caliphate; Abu Bakr and Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab). It was under his military leadership that Arabia, for the first time in history, was united under a single political entity, the Caliphate. He has the distinction of being undefeated in over a hundred battles, against the numerically superior forces of the Byzantine Roman Empire, Sassanid Persian Empire, and their allies, in addition to other Arab tribes. His strategic achievements include the conquest of Arabia, Persian Mesopotamia and Roman Syria within several years from 633 to 636. He is also remembered for his decisive victories at Yamamah, Ullais, Firaz, and his tactical marvels, Walaja and Yarmouk.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khaled ibn Walid was from the Meccan tribe of Quraysh, who initially opposed Muhammad. He played a vital role in Qurayshi victory at the Battle of Uhud. He converted to Islam, however, and joined Muhammad after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and participated in various expeditions for him, such as the Battle of Mu'tah. After Muhammad's death, he played a key role in commanding Medinan forces for Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars, the capture of the Sassanid Arab client Kingdom of Al-Hirah, and the defeat of the Sassanid Persian forces during his conquest of Iraq. He then crossed the desert to capture the Byzantine Arab client state of the Ghassanids during his conquest of Roman Syria. Even though Umar later relieved him of high command, he remained the effective leader of the forces arrayed against the Byzantines during the early stages of the Byzantine-Arab Wars. Under his command, Damascus was captured in 634 and the key Arab victory against the Roman Byzantine forces was achieved at the Battle of Yarmouk (636), which led to the conquest of the Bilad al-Sham (Levant).[PARAGRAPH:2]Khalid died and was buried in 642 in Emesa (Hims), Syria.

		<German>[TAB]Chalid ibn al-Walid (* um 584 in Mekka; ? 642 in Emesa (Syrien)) war ein Gef&#228;hrte Mohammeds und ein bedeutender arabischer Feldherr der islamischen Eroberungskriege. Chalid ibn al-Walid entstammte der Sippe Banu Machzum vom Stamm der Qurais in Mekka. Er geh&#246;rte zun&#228;chst zu den Gegnern des Propheten Muhammad und besiegte als Reiterf&#252;hrer von Mekka die Muslime 625 in der Schlacht von Uhud. In der Folgezeit trat er aber zum Islam &#252;ber und wurde ein wichtiger Heerf&#252;hrer Muhammads. So rettete er in der Schlacht bei Muta 629 die Muslime vor der Umzingelung durch die Byzantiner. Als nach dem Tod Muhammads die Ridda-Kriege ausbrachen, schlug er unter dem Kalifen Abu Bakr den Aufstand der St&#228;mme auf der Arabischen Halbinsel nieder und k&#228;mpfte unter anderem gegen Musailima (632). 633 besiegte er die persische Armee in der Schlacht von Walaja, eroberte Hira und unterwarf die Lachmiden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ab 635 widmete er sich vermehrt der Umstrukturierung der Streitkr&#228;fte nach byzantinischem Muster. Er bildete kleine Kampfeinheiten anstelle der Stammesaufgebote. W&#228;hrend die Formationen der St&#228;mme in langen nur drei Mann tiefen Linien aufmarschiert waren, formierte al-Walid dichte Infanteriekolonnen wie Byzanz. Diese neuen Formationen wurden nach Bogensch&#252;tzen, Infanterie und lanzenbewaffneter Kavallerie in Einheiten eingeteilt und unter das Kommando kampferprobter Kommandeure gestellt, die die Stammesf&#252;rsten und Clanchefs abl&#246;sten. Er stellte auch als Erster arabische Quartiermeistereinheiten zur Versorgung der Truppen auf. Durch seine Reformen wurde die sp&#228;tere Expansion des Islam erm&#246;glicht.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sein Grab befindet sich im syrischen Homs in der nach ihm benannten Moschee.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Magna Carta, also called Magna Carta Libertatum (the Great Charter of Freedoms), is an English legal charter, originally issued in the year 1215. It was written in Latin and is known by its Latin name. The usual English translation of Magna Carta is Great Charter.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta required King John of England to proclaim certain rights (pertaining to freemen), respect certain legal procedures, and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects, whether free or fettered - and implicitly supported what became the writ of habeas corpus, allowing appeal against unlawful imprisonment.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta was arguably the most significant early influence on the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law today in the English speaking world. Magna Carta influenced the development of the common law and many constitutional documents, including the United States Constitution. Many clauses were renewed throughout the Middle Ages, and continued to be renewed as late as the 18th century. By the second half of the 19th century, however, most clauses in their original form had been repealed from English law.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta was the first document forced onto an English King by a group of his subjects (the barons) in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their privileges. It was preceded by the 1100 Charter of Liberties in which King Henry I voluntarily stated that his own powers were under the law.[PARAGRAPH:2]The charter was an important part of the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law in the English speaking world, and it was Magna Carta (rather than other early concessions by the monarch) which survived to become a "sacred text". In practice, Magna Carta in the medieval period mostly did not limit the power of Kings; but by the time of the English Civil War it had become an important symbol for those who wished to show that the King was bound by the law.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magna Carta is normally understood to refer to a single document, that of 1215.

		<English>[TAB]The Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by King Andrew II of Hungary. The law established the rights of Hungary's noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (jus resistendi). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it. This was also a historically important document because it set down the principles of equality for all of the nation's nobility. Seven copies of the edict were created, one for each of the following institutions: to the Pope, to the Knights Templar, to the Knights Hospitaller, to the Hungarian king itself, to the chapters of Esztergom and Kalocsa and to the palatine.[PARAGRAPH:2]The charter's creation was influenced by the emergence of a nobility middle class, unusual in the nation's feudal system. As a regular gesture of generosity, King Andrew often donated property to particularly faithful servants, who thereafter gained new economic and class power. With the nation's class system and economic state changing, King Andrew found himself coerced into decreeing the Golden Bull of 1222 to calm the waters between hereditary nobles and the budding middle class nobility.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Golden Bull is often compared to the Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while the Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.</English>

		<Italian>[TAB]The Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by King Andrew II of Hungary. The law established the rights of Hungary's noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (jus resistendi). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it.

It was the residence of the Muslim kings of Granada and their court, but is currently a museum exhibiting exquisite Islamic architecture. A Renaissance palace was also inserted by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name Alhambra, signifying in Arabic the red, derives from the colour of the red clay of the surroundings of which the fort is made.

The first reference to the Qal'at al Hamra was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies during the rule of the Abdallah (who reigned from 888-912). In one particularly fierce and bloody skirmish, the Muladies soundly defeated the Arabs who were then forced to take shelter in a primitive red castle located in the province of Elvira, nowadays located in Granada. According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small and its walls were not capable of deterring army intent on conquering. The castle was then largely ignored until the eleventh century when its ruins were renovated and rebuilt by Samuel ibn Naghralla, vizier to the King Badis of the Zirid Dynasty, in an attempt to preserve the small Jewish settlement also located on the Sabikah hill.

This was replaced by a new church on its present site in 832; from the same century dates the first San Marco's Campanile (bell tower). The new church was burned in a rebellion in 976, rebuilt in 978 and again to form the basis of the present basilica since 1063. The basilica was consecrated in 1094, the same year in which the body of San Marco was supposedly rediscovered in a pillar by Vitale Faliero, doge at the time. The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing San Marco's Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace. Within the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new fa&#231;ade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the domes were covered with higher wooden, lead-covered domes in order to blend in with the Gothic architecture of the redesigned Doge's Palace.</English>

For its opulent design, gilded Byzantine mosaics, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building was known by the nickname Chiesa d'Oro (Church of gold).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first San Marco's was a temporary building in the Doge's Palace, constructed in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of San Marco the Evangelist from Alexandria. This was replaced by a new church on its present site in 832; from the same century dates the first San Marco's Campanile (bell tower). The new church was burned in a rebellion in 976, rebuilt in 978 and again to form the basis of the present basilica since 1063. The basilica was consecrated in 1094, the same year in which the body of San Marco was supposedly rediscovered in a pillar by Vitale Faliero, doge at the time. The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing San Marco's Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace. Within the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new fa&#231;ade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the domes were covered with higher wooden, lead-covered domes in order to blend in with the Gothic architecture of the redesigned Doge's Palace.</Spanish>

		<German>[TAB]Das Brandenburger Tor in Berlin steht am Pariser Platz in der Dorotheenstadt im Ortsteil Mitte (Bezirk Mitte). Es wurde in den Jahren von 1788 bis 1791 auf Anweisung des preu&#223;ischen K&#246;nigs Friedrich Wilhelm II. von Carl Gotthard Langhans errichtet und ist das bekannteste Wahrzeichen der Stadt. Zugleich ist das Tor ein nationales Symbol, mit dem viele wichtige Ereignisse der Geschichte Berlins, Deutschlands, Europas und der Welt des 20. Jahrhunderts verbunden sind. Der Bau ist dem fr&#252;hklassizistischen Stil zuzuordnen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit dem Bau der Zollmauer der Stadt Berlin wurde 1734 ein Vorg&#228;ngerbau des heutigen Brandenburger Tores als Stadttor an der Stra&#223;e nach Brandenburg an der Havel errichtet. Die Toranlage bestand aus Pylonen und beigeordneten Wachh&#228;usern. Im Zuge des Ausbaus der Mauer und ihrer Tore lie&#223; Friedrich Wilhelm II. ab 1788 das Brandenburger Tor neu gestalten, das dem Andenken an den Krieg des kurz zuvor verstorbenen Friedrich II. diente, von dessen Verdiensten auch etwas Glanz auf den Neffen und Nachfolger fallen sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Architekt wurde Carl Gotthard Langhans beauftragt. Er orientierte sich an dem "Stadttor von Athen", das er aus Stichen von Leroy, Stuart und Revett kannte, die aber die Propyl&#228;en der Athener Akropolis abgebildet hatten. Das Eingangstor zur Akropolis war im dorischen Stil des Parthenon gehalten, um eine optische Einheit zu bilden. Das Tor hatte eine breite Mittel&#246;ffnung und zwei schmale Seiteneing&#228;nge f&#252;r Fu&#223;g&#228;nger. Im rechten Winkel dazu standen zwei Seitenfl&#252;gel. Nach Langhans Planung sollten entsprechend beim Berliner Tor durch den breiten Mittelgang die k&#246;niglichen Kutschen, daneben die sonstigen Gespanne fahren und au&#223;en die Fu&#223;g&#228;nger gehen. In den Seitenfl&#252;geln sollten die Wache und die Akziseeinnehmer untergebracht werden. 1788 wurde das alte Tor abgerissen, eine gro&#223;e Baugrube ausgehoben und fundamentiert. 1789 wurde der Neubau begonnen. Die Baukosten lagen bei 111.000 Talern. Am 6. August 1791 wurde das noch nicht ganz fertige Tor ge&#246;ffnet.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die 1793 von Johann Gottfried Schadow gefertigte Quadriga auf dem Brandenburger Tor stellte urspr&#252;nglich nach der wohl &#252;berwiegend vertretenen Auffassung eine gefl&#252;gelte Friedensbringerin dar. Das Brandenburger Tor erhielt den Namen Friedenstor, diesen Namen zeigte auch eine Inschrift aus Bronzelettern am Tor. Diese Sinngebung interpretiert auch der bildliche Schmuck. Die Entw&#252;rfe f&#252;r die Reliefs wurden vorwiegend von dem Maler und Akademiedirektor Christian Bernhard Rode angefertigt. Schadow hat die Entw&#252;rfe &#252;berarbeitet und die Steinmetze bei der Ausf&#252;hrung beaufsichtigt. Die G&#246;ttin in der Quadriga wird durch das Relief auf der Attika der Stadtseite als Friedensbringerin erkl&#228;rt. Das Attikarelief steht unter dem Thema "Der Zug der Friedensg&#246;ttin". Im Zentrum des Reliefs &#252;ber dem Mittelgang stehen Sinnbilder auf Frieden und Freundschaft. Die Friedensg&#246;ttin Eirene steht auf der &#228;u&#223;ersten Kante eines Triumphwagens. Mit der Rechten st&#252;tzt sie sich auf den mit einer Lorbeergirlande geschm&#252;ckten Rand des Wagens. In der einen Hand h&#228;lt sie einen Palmenzweig, in der anderen einen Lorbeerkranz. Ihr Wagen wird von vier Eroten gezogen. Weiter rechts auf dem Attikarelief kann man Nike mit Fl&#252;geln und Tropaion erkennen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Direkt &#252;ber diesem Relief steht die Quadriga Schadows. Deren g&#246;ttliche Wagenlenkerin ist Nike und Eirene in einer Person. Nach einer abweichenden Auffassung soll es sich von Anfang an um eine "Siegesg&#246;ttin" gehandelt haben, unter anderem weil davon bereits im Vertrag zur Anfertigung der Figurengruppe vom 22. Juli 1789 die Rede gewesen sei. Schadow hatte urspr&#252;nglich f&#252;r die Wagenlenkerin keine Troph&#228;e entworfen. Ihm schwebte mehr die griechische Eirene als Friedensg&#246;ttin vor, als die r&#246;mische Siegesg&#246;ttin Viktoria. 1793 verlangte dann aber ein Akademiebeschluss eine Kopie der Siegestroph&#228;e der Nike rechts auf dem Attikarelief auch f&#252;r die Wagenlenkerin der Quadriga. Bei der Bev&#246;lkerung fand sie keinen Zuspruch. Aufgrund heftiger Kritik besserte Schadow noch ein weiteres Mal nach. Das Tropaion wurde nun durch eine Lanze mit einem Lorbeerkranz und einem r&#246;mischen Adler ersetzt. Au&#223;erdem erhielt die knapp bekleidete Wagenlenkerin nun ein bis auf den Boden reichendes Gewand.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Dome of the Rock is located at the visual center of an ancient man-made platform known as the Temple Mount, which Muslims refer to as the "Noble Sanctuary". The platform, greatly enlarged under the rule of Herod the Great, is the site of the Second Jewish Temple which was destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In 637 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate army during the Islamic invasion of the Byzantine Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock was erected between 685 and 691 CE. The names of the two engineers in charge of the project are given as: Yazid Ibn Salam from Jerusalem and Raja Ibn Haywah from Baysan. Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who initiated construction of the Dome, hoped that it would "house the Muslims from cold and heat" and intended the building to serve as a shrine for pilgrims and not as a mosque for public worship. Historians contend that the Caliph wished to create a structure which would compete with the existing buildings of other religions in the city. al-Maqdisi writes that he "Sought to build for the Muslims a masjid that should be unique and a wonder to the world. And in like manner, is it not evident that Caliph Abd al-Malik, seeing the greatness of the martyrium of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and its magnificence was moved lest it should dazzle the minds of Muslims and hence erected above the Rock the dome which is now seen there."[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Crusades the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104. The Knights Templar, who believed the Dome of the Rock was the site of the Temple of Solomon, set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The "Templum Domini," as they called it, was featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters, and it became the architectural model for Templar churches across Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on Friday, 2 October 1187 and the Haram was reconsecrated as a Muslim sanctuary. The cross on top of the Dome of the Rock was replaced by a golden crescent and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Salah al-Din's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa (615-24/1218-27) carried out other restorations within the Haram and added the porch to the Aqsa mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]Large-scale renovation was undertaken during the reign of Mahmud II in 1817. Adjacent to the Dome of the Rock, the Ottomans built the free-standing Dome of the Prophet in 1620.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock was badly shaken during an earthquake in Palestine on Monday, 11 July 1927 rendering useless many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Jordanian rule of Jerusalem, Jews were forbidden from entering the Old City. Israel took control of the Dome of the Rock during its victory in the Six-Day War in 1967. A few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967, at the conclusion of the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of General Moshe Dayan, and invested the Muslim Waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount-Haram al-Sharif in order to "keep the peace".[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dome of the Rock, being among a complex of buildings on the Temple Mount, (the other principal building being the Al-Aqsa Mosque) is one of the holiest sites in Islam, following Mecca, Medina, and, for shia Muslims, the Imam Ali Mosque. Its significance stems from the religious beliefs regarding the rock at its heart. According to Islamic tradition, the rock is the spot from where Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel.[PARAGRAPH:2]The stone over which the Muslim shrine, the Dome of Rock, was built is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews have traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period. In former times, some Jewish scholars thought that the location of the Holy of Holies was not known for certain. Today this is a minority opinion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Just as Muslims pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, Jews pray towards the site of the ancient Holy of Holies, the Foundation Stone, the holiest site in Judaism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Christianity it is believed that during the time of the Byzantine Empire, nearby the spot where the Dome was later constructed was where Constantine's mother built a small church, calling it the Church of St. Cyrus and St. John, later on enlarged and called the Church of the Holy Wisdom. On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes the following words:[PARAGRAPH:2]"Bless your envoy and your servant Jesus son of Mary and peace upon him on the day of birth and on the day of death and on the day he is raised up again. It is a word of truth in which they doubt. It is not for God to take a son. Glory be to him when he decrees a thing he only says be, and it is."</English>

Jews have traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period. In former times, some Jewish scholars thought that the location of the Holy of Holies was not known for certain. Today this is a minority opinion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Just as Muslims pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, Jews pray towards the site of the ancient Holy of Holies, the Foundation Stone, the holiest site in Judaism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Christianity it is believed that during the time of the Byzantine Empire, nearby the spot where the Dome was later constructed was where Constantine's mother built a small church, calling it the Church of St. Cyrus and St. John, later on enlarged and called the Church of the Holy Wisdom. On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes the following words:[PARAGRAPH:2]"Bless your envoy and your servant Jesus son of Mary and peace upon him on the day of birth and on the day of death and on the day he is raised up again. It is a word of truth in which they doubt. It is not for God to take a son. Glory be to him when he decrees a thing he only says be, and it is."</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Mezquita (Spanish for "mosque") of C&#243;rdoba or Cordova is a Roman Catholic cathedral originally built as a mosque in the Andalusian city of C&#243;rdoba, Spain. It is regarded as perhaps the most accomplished monument of the Umayyad dynasty of C&#243;rdoba. After the Spanish Reconquista, it was turned into a church, with a Gothic cathedral inserted into the center of the large Moorish building. Today the entire building is used to house the Cathedral of the diocese of C&#243;rdoba in Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]The building was begun in approximately 600 A.D. as the Christian Visigothic church of St. Vincent. The first Muslim Emir Abd ar-Rahman I bought the church and reworked it over two centuries to refashion it as a mosque, starting in 784 A.D. Additionally, Abd ar-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it to honor his wife. According to some authors the church of St. Vincent was demolished after it was bought from the local Christian community.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several explanations have been proposed to explain the mosque's unorthodox orientation. Some have suggested the mihrab faces south because the foundations of the mosque were taken from the old Roman and Visigoth constructions. Others contend that Abd ar-Rahman oriented the mihrab southward as if he were still in the Ummayyad capital of Damascus and not in exile.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd ar-Rahman III ordered a new minaret; Al-Hakam II, in 961, enlarged the building and enriched the mihrab. The last of the reforms was carried out by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir in 987.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was the most magnificent of the more than 1,000 mosques in the city and was at one time the second largest mosque in the Muslim world. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walk-way, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for the Islamic rulers of all times.[PARAGRAPH:2]The city in which it was built was subject to frequent invasion and each conquering wave added their own mark to the architecture. The building is most notable for its giant arches, with over 1,000 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, as well as other destroyed Roman buildings. The double arches, pictured above, were a new introduction to architecture, and helped support the tremendous weight of the higher ceilings. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The Mezquita also features richly gilded prayer niches. A centrally located honey-combed dome has beautiful blue tiles decorated with stars. The mihrab is a masterpiece of architectural art, with geometric and flowing designs of plants. The Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 A.D. with the completion of the outer naves and orange tree courtyard.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1236, C&#243;rdoba was recaptured from the Muslim army by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the mosque was reconsecrated as a Christian church. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features: Enrique II rebuilt the chapel in the 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The most significant alteration was building a Renaissance cathedral nave in the middle of the structure. It was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of united Spain. Its reversion to a Christian church (officially the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin) may have helped to preserve it when the Spanish Inquisition was most active.[PARAGRAPH:2]Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Abtei von Cluny in Burgund war als Ausgangspunkt bedeutender Klosterreformen eines der einflussreichsten religi&#246;sen Zentren des Mittelalters. Ihre Kirche war zeitweise das gr&#246;&#223;te Gotteshaus des Christentums. Mehrere Geb&#228;ude der Benediktinerabtei und einige Reste der im Zuge der Franz&#246;sischen Revolution abgerissenen Abteikirche im Zentrum der gleichnamigen franz&#246;sischen Stadt Cluny sind erhalten. Als erstes Monument in Frankreich hat der franz&#246;sische Staat die Abtei 2007 mit dem Europ&#228;ischen Kulturerbe-Siegel ausgezeichnet.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cluny wurde mit Urkunde vom 11. September 910 durch Wilhelm I. Herzog von Aquitanien und Graf von M&#226;connais als Benediktinerkloster gegr&#252;ndet. Dabei verzichtete Herzog Wilhelm auf jede Gewalt &#252;ber das Kloster und schloss jegliche Einmischung weltlicher oder geistlicher Gewalt in die internen Angelegenheiten des Klosters aus (Exemtion und Immunit&#228;t). Insbesondere wurde auf die wirtschaftliche Nutzung verzichtet. Das Kloster selbst wurde unter den direkten Schutz des Papstes gestellt. F&#252;r die Verh&#228;ltnisse des 10. Jahrhunderts war dies eine Neuerung. Wilhelm ernannte lediglich den ersten Abt Berno und erlaubte dem Konvent danach eine freie Abtswahl. Diese beiden Neuerungen, Exemtion und freie Abtswahl, trugen wesentlich zur Entfaltung Clunys bei. Zusammen mit einer strengen Auslegung der Benediktusregel machten sie Cluny zum Ausgangs- und Mittelpunkt der cluniazensischen Reform, in deren Bl&#252;tezeit etwa 1.200 Kl&#246;ster mit rund 20.000 M&#246;nchen zu Cluny geh&#246;rten. Eines der wichtigsten Priorate lag in La Charit&#233;-sur-Loire. Bemerkenswert war die straffe Ordnung innerhalb der Gemeinschaft.

		<English>[TAB]The original walls of Constantinople were built in the 8th century BC when Byzantium was founded by Greek colonists from Megara. At the time the city consisted of an acropolis and little more. The colony was relatively unimportant by the Roman period, but Septimius Severus built a new set of walls during his reign, bringing more land into the city. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople, he greatly expanded the walls of the city, incorporating even more territory.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 412 the Roman emperor Theodosius II surrounded Constantinople with a wall that stretched 6.5 kilometers between the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn. Although named after Theodosius, they were actually constructed under the direction of Anthemius, Praetorian prefect of the Eastern Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The walls were built of stone and brick in two lines of defense which adjoined a ditch 20 meters wide and 10 meters deep. The inner wall had was 5 meters thick and 12 meters high. It was strengthened with 96 unapproachable towers 18-20 meters tall. The thickness of the external wall was 2 meters, and its height was 8.5 meters. The wall contained the Belgrad, Silivrikapi, Mevlevihane, Topkapi, Edirnekapi, Egrikapi and Yedikule gates. Yedikule Gate was also known as the "Porta Aurea" or "Golden Gate", and was the most magnificent, consisting of three archways. As the state entrance into the capital, the Golden Gate was architecturally splendid, and was built of large square blocks of polished marble fitted together without cement, and flanked by two great towers of the same material. Upon the gates were placed sculpted elephants.[PARAGRAPH:2]The inner walls had massive square or hexagonal towers. The southern end of the walls, at the Sea of Marmara, was the location of the Marble Tower. There were ten gates, the four major ones being the Golden Gate at the southern end, the Selymbria Gate leading to the Forum of Constantine and Hagia Sophia, the Adrianople Gate connecting Constantinople's Mese (the main street) with the city of Adrianople and the Via Egnatia, and the Blachernae Gate in the north.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 439 the first sea walls were built. In 447 the wall was damaged by an earthquake, but was quickly restored in time to stop Attila's army. In the northwestern corner of the city, in the suburb of Blachernae, the Theodosian walls were relatively weaker, but were expanded by Leo I. The northern coast of the city, along the Golden Horn, also had a separate set of walls.[PARAGRAPH:2]These walls were almost inpenetrable, saving the city during sieges from the Bulgars, Arabs, and Rus', among others. The first attackers to break through the walls were the knights of the Fourth Crusade, who managed to scale the lower sea walls and also break the Wall of Leo in the northwestern Blachernae section of the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The second and final time the walls were breached was during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453, by the Ottomans; however, they did not break through by force, but entered through the Kerkoporta Gate, which happened to be open, apparently accidentally but possibly through treachery. A large plaque today marks the spot where the Ottomans entered. Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects. Within a few years, due to the renewed importance of the city as the new Ottoman capital, the population started to soar again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Ottomans, the Golden Gate, known to them as Yedikule ("the Seven Towers"), was used as a prison. Many parts of the walls are still standing today and are a testament to the extraordinary longevity of the empire. They have been damaged by recent earthquakes, but many sections have also been restored. The wall runs through the suburbs of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course. The walls are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city.</English>

The thickness of the external wall was 2 meters, and its height was 8.5 meters. The wall contained the Belgrad, Silivrikapi, Mevlevihane, Topkapi, Edirnekapi, Egrikapi and Yedikule gates. Yedikule Gate was also known as the "Porta Aurea" or "Golden Gate", and was the most magnificent, consisting of three archways. As the state entrance into the capital, the Golden Gate was architecturally splendid, and was built of large square blocks of polished marble fitted together without cement, and flanked by two great towers of the same material. Upon the gates were placed sculpted elephants.[PARAGRAPH:2]The inner walls had massive square or hexagonal towers. The southern end of the walls, at the Sea of Marmara, was the location of the Marble Tower. There were ten gates, the four major ones being the Golden Gate at the southern end, the Selymbria Gate leading to the Forum of Constantine and Hagia Sophia, the Adrianople Gate connecting Constantinople's Mese (the main street) with the city of Adrianople and the Via Egnatia, and the Blachernae Gate in the north.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 439 the first sea walls were built. In 447 the wall was damaged by an earthquake, but was quickly restored in time to stop Attila's army. In the northwestern corner of the city, in the suburb of Blachernae, the Theodosian walls were relatively weaker, but were expanded by Leo I. The northern coast of the city, along the Golden Horn, also had a separate set of walls.[PARAGRAPH:2]These walls were almost inpenetrable, saving the city during sieges from the Bulgars, Arabs, and Rus', among others. The first attackers to break through the walls were the knights of the Fourth Crusade, who managed to scale the lower sea walls and also break the Wall of Leo in the northwestern Blachernae section of the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The second and final time the walls were breached was during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453, by the Ottomans; however, they did not break through by force, but entered through the Kerkoporta Gate, which happened to be open, apparently accidentally but possibly through treachery. A large plaque today marks the spot where the Ottomans entered. Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects. Within a few years, due to the renewed importance of the city as the new Ottoman capital, the population started to soar again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Ottomans, the Golden Gate, known to them as Yedikule ("the Seven Towers"), was used as a prison. Many parts of the walls are still standing today and are a testament to the extraordinary longevity of the empire.

Jahrhunderts unter Kaiser Theodosius II. und dem Pr&#228;fekten Anthemius errichtete, etwa 19-20 Kilometer lange Befestigungsanlage (Land- und Seemauern) zum Schutz von Konstantinopel, dem heutigen Istanbul.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Theodosianische Mauer wird von einigen Historikern als eine der erfolgreichsten und bestdurchdachten Befestigungsanlagen in der Geschichte der Kriegstechnik angesehen. Viele der einschneidensten Ereignisse in der Geschichte der Stadt stehen eng mit diesem au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlichen Bauwerk in Zusammenhang. Der Bau des Wallsystems wurde notwendig, um der Bedrohung durch die Hunnen zu begegnen und der rasch expandierenden Stadt zus&#228;tzlichen Raum zu verschaffen. Trotz zunehmenden Verfalles und dem Aufkommen der Feuerwaffen, waren die Befestigungen bei entschlossener Verteidigung auch noch in der Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts nur schwer zu &#252;berwinden. Die Komplexit&#228;t der Verteidigungsanlagen trug wesentlich zum langen Bestehen des Byzantinischen Reiches bei.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Pena National Palace (Portuguese: Pal&#225;cio Nacional da Pena) is a Romanticist palace in S&#227;o Pedro de Penaferrim, municipality of Sintra, Portugal. The palace stands on the top of a hill above the town of Sintra, and on a clear day it can be easily seen from Lisbon.[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace's history started in the Middle Ages when a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Pena was built on the top of the hill above Sintra. According to tradition, the construction occurred after an apparition of the Virgin Mary. In 1493, King John II, accompanied by his wife Queen Leonor, made a pilgrimage to the site to fulfill a vow. His successor, King Manuel I, was also very fond of this sanctuary, and ordered the construction there of a monastery which was donated to the Order of Saint Jerome.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 18th century the monastery was severely damaged by lightning. However, it was the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, occurring shortly afterwards, that took the heaviest toll on the monastery, reducing it to ruins. Nonetheless, the chapel (and its magnificent works of marble and alabaster attributed to Nicolau Chanterene) escaped without significant damage.[PARAGRAPH:2]A couple decades later King consort Ferdinand II decided to acquire the old monastery, all of the surrounding lands, the nearby Castle of the Moors and a few other estates in the area. Later as king he set out to transform the remains of the monastery into a palace that would serve as a summer residence for the Portuguese royal family.[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.</English>

M&#246;glicherweise war das gro&#223;e M&#252;ndungsdelta des Rio de La Plata als Meerenge missdeutet worden. Er entschied, als erster diesen Weg westw&#228;rts zu nutzen, um die Gew&#252;rzinseln (die heutigen Molukken) zu erreichen. Sie stellten einen strategisch wichtigen Ausgangspunkt zum lukrativen Gew&#252;rzhandel dar. Zudem war Magellan &#252;berzeugt, dass die Gew&#252;rzinseln nach dem Vertrag von Tordesillas von 1494 auf der vom Papst Spanien zugesprochenen Welth&#228;lfte l&#228;gen. Unterst&#252;tzung erhielt Magellan bei der Vorbereitung dieses Unterfangens durch den Astronomen Ruy Faleiro, der ebenfalls portugiesischer Herkunft war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Magellan gelang es, einflussreiche Freunde f&#252;r seine Pl&#228;ne zu gewinnen, insbesondere den Faktor der Casa de Contrataci&#243;n (des Indienhauses) Juan de Aranda und den Kardinal von Burgos Juan Rodr&#237;guez de Fonseca. Am 22. M&#228;rz 1518 schloss er in Valladolid einen Vertrag mit Karl I. von Spanien, der Magellan f&#252;nf Schiffe zur Verf&#252;gung stellte, mit denen er die Gew&#252;rzinseln finden sollte. Ihm und Ruy Faleiro wurde ein F&#252;nftel der Reicht&#252;mer zugebilligt, die die Reise einbringen sollte. Sie und ihre Erben sollten in allen entdeckten L&#228;ndern als Gouverneure regieren. Zudem sicherte der Kaiser zu, innerhalb von zehn Jahren keinem anderen diese Reise zu erm&#246;glichen. Die Finanzierung erfolgte durch die spanische Krone und den Reeder Cristobal de Haro, in geringerem Ma&#223;e beteiligte sich das Bankhaus der Augsburger Fugger. Die Flotte fuhr unter der kaiserlichen Flagge des heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches, wohl um von deren zu dieser Zeit hohen Ansehen zu profitieren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Am 10. August 1519 begann die Reise in Sevilla. Am 6. September des Jahres 1522 erreichte die Victoria Sanl&#250;car, den spanischen Ausgangshafen.

Mehr und mehr interessierte er sich dann aber f&#252;r das Wissen &#252;ber die Natur und war fasziniert von deren Vielfalt und Sch&#246;nheit und schrieb:[PARAGRAPH:2]"F&#252;r die Ehrgeizigen, die sich weder mit dem Geschenk des Lebens noch mit der Sch&#246;nheit der Welt zufriedengeben, liegt eine Strafe darin, dass sie sich selbst dieses Leben verbittern und die Vorteile und die Sch&#246;nheit der Welt nicht besitzen."[PARAGRAPH:2]Leonardo verband die Vergilsche Sehnsucht rerum cognoscere causas (die Ursachen der Dinge zu erkennen) mit dem Willen zum sichtbaren Schaffen. Seine Notizb&#252;cher, Zeichnungen und Skizzen bestehen aus ca. 6000 Bl&#228;ttern. Zu seinen Lebzeiten wurde, insbesondere von seinen naturwissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, nichts ver&#246;ffentlicht. Erst im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert fanden sich die Manuskripte in Bibliotheken und privaten Sammlungen und wurden somit erst sp&#228;t gew&#252;rdigt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Er schuf im Laufe seines Lebens eine gro&#223;e Zahl von k&#252;nstlerisch wertvollen Illustrationen zu verschiedenen Themen wie Biologie, Anatomie, Technik, Waffentechnik, Wasserwirtschaft und Architektur und hinterlie&#223; Bauwerke, technische Anlagen und Beobachtungen des Kosmos. Besonders bedeutsam sind seine sehr genauen anatomischen u.a. naturwissenschaftlichen Zeichnungen. Bereits gegen Ende seiner Lebenszeit wurde er als Uomo Universale verehrt und wird auch von heutigen Historikern als eines der au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlichsten Genies aller Zeiten bezeichnet.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev is an outstanding architectural monument of Kievan Rus'. Today, it is one of the city's best known landmarks and the first Ukrainian patrimony to be inscribed on the World Heritage List.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral's name comes from the 6th-century Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople (meaning Holy Wisdom, and dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God rather than a specific saint named Sophia). According to a less popular theory, its model was the 13-domed oaken Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (ca. 989), which Yaroslav I the Wise determined to imitate in stone as a sign of gratitude to the citizens of Novgorod who had helped him secure the Kievan throne in 1019.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first foundations were laid in 1037, but the cathedral took two decades to complete. The structure has 5 naves, 5 apses, and (quite surprisingly for Byzantine architecture) 13 cupolas. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring 37 to 55 m (121 to 180 ft), the exterior used to be faced with plinths. On the inside, it retains mosaics and frescos from the eleventh century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the Virgin Orans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including Vladimir Monomakh, Vsevolod Yaroslavich and of course the cathedral's founder Yaroslav I the Wise, although only the latter's grave survived to our days (see picture).[PARAGRAPH:2]After the pillaging of Kiev by Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal in 1169, followed by Mongolian Tatars in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. Following the 1595-96 Union of Brest, the cathedral of Saint Sophia belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church until it was claimed by the Moldavian Orthodox metropolitan Peter Mogila (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect Octaviano Mancini in the distinct Ukrainian Baroque style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and in 1740 the Cathedral was completed to its present form.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and during the Soviet antireligious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park "Heroes of Perekop" (after a Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War in Crimea). The cathedral was saved from destruction primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, Soviet authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding seventeenth-eighteenth century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various schisms and factions within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, other times they are denied access. Most memorable was the funeral of Patriarch Volodymyr of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy, when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place. After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.[PARAGRAPH:2]The complex of the Cathedral is the main component the National Sanctuary "Sophia of Kiev" the state institution responsible for the preservation of the Cathedral complex along with several other historic landmarks of the city.</English>

Als Hauptkathedrale der Kiewer Rus war sie ihrer christlichen und kulturellen Bedeutung nach dazu berufen, von der Weisheit des Christentums und der Festigung der politischen Macht der Rus zu k&#252;nden. Die Kathedrale war Mittelpunkt des kulturellen und politischen Lebens des altrussischen Staates. Hier fanden unter anderem die Thronbesteigungen der Kiewer F&#252;rsten statt, hier tagte die Kiewer Volksversammlung (Vece), hier wurden Staatsg&#228;ste empfangen und Hofzeremonielle durchgef&#252;hrt.

They were received by the royal court of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, Kublai Khan (grandson of Genghis Khan), who was impressed by Marco's intelligence and humility.[PARAGRAPH:2]Marco was appointed to serve as Khan's foreign emissary to India and Burma, and he was sent on many diplomatic missions throughout the empire.

		<German>[TAB]&#220;ber Marco Polo selbst ist nur wenig &#252;berliefert, aber immerhin gibt es rund 150 Handschriften seines Reiseberichtes. Der Schotte Henry Yule konnte allein schon achtundsiebzig Manuskripte nachweisen. Davon sind 41 in Lateinisch, 21 in Italienisch, zehn in Franz&#246;sisch und vier in Deutsch verfasst. Es wird von vielen Forschern angenommen, dass Polo seine Erlebnisse nicht eigenh&#228;ndig selbst im Gef&#228;ngnis aufschrieb, sondern h&#246;chstens &#252;ber Notizen verf&#252;gte, die er dem Rustichello da Pisa diktierte. Die vergleichenden Forschungen f&#252;hrten zu dem Ergebnis, dass ein Manuskript in altfranz&#246;sischer Sprache eine sehr gro&#223;e N&#228;he zur Urfassung hat. Damit ist das franz&#246;sische Manuskript gemeint, das die Geographische Gesellschaft zu Paris im Jahre 1824 ver&#246;ffentlichte und das seitdem als der "Geographische Text" bezeichnet wird. Von weiterem besonderen Interesse f&#252;r die Forscher sind in dieser Hinsicht auch ein franko-italienischer Text und das lateinische "Zelada-Manuskript", die beide ebenfalls als der Urfassung sehr nahe stehend betrachtet werden. Dar&#252;ber, dass von diesen drei fr&#252;hesten Manuskripten eines der Originalfassung am allern&#228;chsten steht, gibt es bislang keine Einigkeit.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach Ansicht von Barbara Wehr, Professorin f&#252;r Franz&#246;sische und Italienische Sprachwissenschaft der Johannes Gutenberg-Universit&#228;t Mainz, muss die bislang vorherrschende Auffassung, Marco Polo habe seinen Reisebericht dem Rustichello da Pisa diktiert und die Sprache des Urtexts sei Altfranz&#246;sisch, m&#246;glicherweise korrigiert werden. Ihrer Ansicht nach gibt es mit der lateinischen Fassung von Francesco Pipino da Bologna einen Strang der Text&#252;berlieferung, der keinerlei Spuren der franz&#246;sischen Version von Rustichello da Pisa aufweist. Sie schlie&#223;t daraus, dass Rustichello da Pisa sich erst nachtr&#228;glich in die Text&#252;berlieferung eingemischt hat und dass es einen Urtext gab, der direkt aus der Feder Marco Polos stammte und auf Altvenezianisch verfasst war.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Palais des Papes is a historical palace in Avignon, southern France, one of the largest and most important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Avignon became the residence of the Popes in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as Pope Clement V, unwilling to face the violent chaos of Rome after his election (1305), moved the Papal Curia to Avignon, a period known as the Avignon Papacy. Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor Pope John XXII set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by Pope Benedict XII (1334-42) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river Rh&#244;ne, was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and Palais Neuf (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of 11,000 m2 (2.6 acres). The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of Pope Benedict XII. The austere Benedict had the old/new episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centreed on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Popes Clement VI, Innocent VI and Urban V, the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. Jean de Louvres was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.[PARAGRAPH:2]The popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the Papal Schism during which time the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII made Avignon their home until 1408. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for ten years after being besieged when in 1398 Geoffrey Boucicaut led an army of occupation. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years - it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 - but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and Comtat Venaissin) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Palais was subsequently taken over by the Napoleonic French state for use as a military barracks and prison.

		<English>[TAB]Notre Dame is a mighty cathedral standing on the "Ile de la Citie," an island in the Seine River in Paris, France. Built on the site of an older church, which was in turn built on the site of a Roman temple to Jupiter, Notre Dame is a magnificent example of gothic architecture and one of the greatest buildings standing. Construction of Notre Dame began in 1163 and took almost two centuries to complete. [PARAGRAPH:2]Notre Dame is a massive stone building of square towers, flying buttresses, and tall spires. The exterior of the building is decorated with delicate ribbons of arches and statues of saints and kings. The roofline of the building is festooned with gargoyles. The interior of the cathedral is a long, narrow space with columns lining each side, supporting two beautiful raised galleries. Brilliant stained glass windows shine gently down on the main altar, which contains a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary, the cathedral's patron, holding the body of Jesus. [PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral has suffered many periods of neglect over the years. During the French Revolution, many of Notre Dame's treasures were stolen and the building was used as a warehouse. In the early 1800s, the cathedral was in such a state of disrepair that the city planners contemplated tearing it down. In fact, Victor Hugo wrote "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in part to raise awareness of the cathedral's plight. In 1871, during the short-lived Paris Commune, Notre Dame was almost set on fire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Fortunately the cathedral survived it all, and has now been largely restored to its original grandeur.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Bel&#233;m Tower is a fortified tower located in the Bel&#233;m district of Lisbon, Portugal.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Bel&#233;m Tower was built in the early sixteenth century in the Portuguese late-Gothic style, the Manueline, to commemorate Vasco da Gama's expedition. This defensive, yet elegant construction has become one of the symbols of the city, a memorial to Portuguese power as it was during the Age of Discovery. In 1983, it was classified, together with the nearby Mosteiro dos Jer&#243;nimos (Jer&#243;nimos Monastery), as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Bel&#233;m Tower was built both as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon and as part of a defensive system at the entrance to the Tagus river. The system was initiated by King John II (1455-1495), who built the Fortress of Cascais and the Fortress of S&#227;o Sebasti&#227;o of Caparica. The shore of Bel&#233;m had been protected by a ship, the Grande Nau, but it was replaced by the Tower of Bel&#233;m during the last five years of the reign of King Manuel I. It was dedicated to the patron saint of Lisbon, St Vincent.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower was constructed, between 1515 and 1521, by the military architect, Francisco de Arruda, who had already built several fortresses in Portuguese territories in Morocco. The influence of Moorish architecture is manifest in the delicate decorations, the arched windows, the balconies, and the ribbed cupolas of the watchtowers.

With the progressive southward creep of the shoreline over the years, the tower is now practically 'moored' to the bank itself.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1580, when Lisbon was invaded by Spanish troops in the course of a struggle for the Portuguese throne, defenders of the tower fought and surrendered to the Duke of Alba. During subsequent centuries, the tower was mainly used as a prison (even though the cellars flooded regularly) and as a custom house. Indeed, given its height and lack of integration into the landscape, some historians believe the tower was always intended to serve as a customs outpost.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1840s, at the urging of romantic writer Almeida Garrett, the Tower of Bel&#233;m was restored by King Ferdinand II.

Neben dem nahegelegenen Mosteiro dos Jer&#243;nimos geh&#246;rt der Turm zu den wenigen herausragenden Bauwerken des manuelinischen Stils, die das Erdbeben von Lissabon &#252;berstanden haben. Die oberste, 35 Meter hohe, freiliegende Etage des Turms ist heute eine Aussichtsplattform.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im Jahre 1515 wurde der Turm vom portugiesischen K&#246;nig, Manuel I., in Auftrag gegeben. Sechs Jahre sp&#228;ter, im Todesjahr Manuels (1521) wurde er fertiggestellt. Er versinnbildlicht seitdem die Glanzzeit des portugiesischen See- und Handelsimperiums. Als Leuchtturm auf einem Felsen im M&#252;ndungstrichter des Tejo gelegen, begr&#252;&#223;te er die ankommenden Entdecker und Handelsschiffe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als Schutzsymbol der Seefahrer blickt eine Statue Unserer Lieben Frau der sicheren Heimkehr auf das Meer. An der Nordwestseite des Turmes befindet sich zudem eine Plastik eines Nashornkopfes, welche die erste plastische Darstellung dieses Tieres in Europa ist. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Abbildung des Panzernashorns, welches Afonso de Albuquerque 1515 von seiner Indienfahrt mitbrachte und sp&#228;ter auch Albrecht D&#252;rer die Vorlage f&#252;r den Holzschnitt seines "Rhinozeros" lieferte. Die Bastion erh&#228;lt ihren eigenen Charakter durch die reichen Ausschm&#252;ckungen mit Schnurreliefen, schildf&#246;rmigen Zinnen, durchbrochenen Balkonen und maurischen Ausgucken.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das d&#252;stere Innere diente bis ins 19. Jahrhundert als Gef&#228;ngnis und Waffenlager. Im 19. Jahrhundert kam es zu Aufsch&#252;ttungen am n&#246;rdlichen Tejoufer.

In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Near two thirds of the surviving volumes had not been printed before the king's death. Some of them contained the sole copy of the works in them, like the book of Constantine Porphyrogennetos on the habits in the court of the Byzantine emperor, or the church history of Nikephoros Kallistos. We also know about Corvinae, with which the only copy of ancient books perished, including the full works of Hypereides, writings by Flavius Cresconius Corippus, Cuspinianus and Procopius.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Louvre is a large and incredibly ornate palace in Paris, France. It was originally built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the palace. Due to the urban expansion of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by Francis I into the main residence of the French Kings. For the next two and a half centuries the Louvre served as the home to many of France's kings, most of whom added to the already-huge structure.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 17th century Kings Louis XIII and Louis XIV and their advisors Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin began acquiring an extensive art collection which was kept at the Louvre. In 1682 the Royal court moved to Versailles, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1793 the Revolutionary government opened the palace to the public, and it has remained a public museum ever since. Not surprisingly, it is considered to have the finest collection of pre-modern French paintings in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today the Louvre is the world's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square metres (782,910 square feet). In 2017, the Louvre was the world's most visited art museum, receiving 8.1 million visitors.</English>

On the walls of this seacoast palace hung hundreds of paintings that Peter brought from Europe and allowed to weather Russian winters without heat together with the dampness of being so close to the sea. And in the seaward corner of his Monplaisir Palace, Peter made his Maritime Study from which he could see Kronstadt Island to the left and St. Petersburg to the right. Later, he expanded his plans to include a vaster royal chateau of palaces and gardens further inland, on the model of Versailles.

		<English>[TAB]Uraniborg (Danish: Uranienborg, Swedish: Uraniborg) was a Danish astronomical observatory and alchemy laboratory established and operated by Tycho Brahe. It was built between 1576 and 1580 on Hven, an island in the Oresund between Zealand and Scania (which was part of Denmark at the time), under the sponsorship of King Frederic II of Denmark (1534-1588). The building was dedicated to Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, and it was named Uraniborg, "The Castle of Urania." It was the first time in Europe that a building was erected especially for the purpose of astronomical observations.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tycho Brahe was one of the most important observational astronomers until the invention of the telescope in 1608. His castle observatory was, at the end of the 16th century, an impressive advanced research centre, both for studying astronomy and in respect of the innovative precise instruments.[PARAGRAPH:2]The observatory measured 16m x 16m, with a 19m tower and two small round towers to the north and south of 6m diameter (with cone shaped roof), with galleries around for the instruments. Inside the observatory was a large mural quadrant affixed to a north-south wall, which was used to measure the altitude of stars as they passed the meridian. The engraving of the mural quadrant from Brahe's book Astronomiae instauratae mechanica (1598) shows very well the ongoing work in the observatory. The observatory is in the middle of a strongly geometrical Renaissance garden; in addition Tycho had a printing office and a water mill for making paper.</English>

		<English>[TAB]St. Thomas Church (German: Thomaskirche) is a Lutheran church in Leipzig, Germany. It is associated with a number of well-known composers such as Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, but mostly with Johann Sebastian Bach who worked here as a Kapellmeister (music director) from 1723 until his death in 1750. Today, the church also holds his remains. The Thomaskirche was one of the earlier adopters of the Reformation, Martin Luther preached here in 1539.[PARAGRAPH:2]The choir of the Thomaskirche, the Thomanerchor, was founded in 1212 and is one of the oldest and most famous boys' choirs in Germany. It is headed by the Thomaskantor, an office that has been held by many well-known composers and musicians. Bach held the title Thomaskantor too from 1723 until 1750.[PARAGRAPH:2]Few composers were more prolific or beloved than Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach, the most well-known member of a gifted family of German musicians, was perhaps the finest composer of the baroque style of music. In his time, he wrote numerous choral and orchestral pieces. During his lifetime, he was renowned as an organist and music director of St. Thomas' Church in Leipzig, and many of his compositions were religious in nature. After his death, Bach's music gained worldwide appreciation.</English>

Fontainebleau ideals of female beauty are Mannerist: a small neat head on a long neck, exaggeratedly long torso and limbs, small high breasts; almost a return to Late Gothic beauties. The new works at Fontainebleau were recorded in refined and detailed engravings that circulated among connoisseurs and artists. Through the engravings by the "School of Fontainebleau" this new style was transmitted to other northern European centres, Antwerp especially, and Germany, and eventually London.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Reichstag ("Imperial Diet") was the assembly of the various estates of which the Holy Roman Empire was comprised.

Initially, there was neither a fixed time nor location for the Reichstag. It started as a convention of the dukes of the old Germanic tribes that formed the Frankish kingdom when important decisions had to be made, probably based on the old Germanic law that each leader relied on the support of his leading men. For example, already under Charlemagne, the Reichstag in Aachen in 802/803 officially declared the laws of the Saxons and other tribes. The Reichstag of 919 in Fritzlar elected the first king of the Germans who was a Saxon, Henry the Fowler, thus overcoming the longstanding rivalry between Franks and Saxons and laying the foundation for the German Empire. In 1158, the Reichstag in Roncaglia finalized four laws that would significantly alter the (never formally written) constitution of the Empire, marking the beginning of the steady decline of the central power in favor of the local dukes. In 1356, the Golden Bull cemented the concept of Landesherrschaft ("territorial rule"), the largely independent rule of the dukes over their respective territories.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Der Begriff Reichstag bezeichnet urspr&#252;nglich die Versammlung der Reichsst&#228;nde des Heiligen R&#246;mischen Reiches. Die neben dem K&#246;nig/Kaiser stehende K&#246;rperschaft entwickelte sich seit dem 12. Jahrhundert aus den formlosen Hoftagen und wurde 1495 mittels eines Vertrages zwischen dem Kaiser und den St&#228;nden zu einer festen Institution der Reichsverfassung.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Reichstag wurde bis zum 16. Jahrhundert in unregelm&#228;&#223;igen Abst&#228;nden jeweils in eine Bischofs- oder Reichsstadt einberufen und war das ma&#223;gebliche Gegengewicht der St&#228;nde gegen&#252;ber der kaiserlichen Zentralgewalt. Seit 1663 tagte der Immerw&#228;hrende Reichstag als st&#228;ndiger Gesandtenkongress in Regensburg.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Reichstag trat bis 1663 etwa 40- bis 45-mal zusammen und konnte einige Wochen, aber auch mehrere Monate dauern. Der Reichstag begann - zumindest in seiner nicht-permanenten Zeit - neben zeremoniellen Akten mit der Verlesung der kaiserlichen Proposition, der vom Kaiser vorab festgelegten Tagesordnung, im sog. Reichsrat und endete mit der Verlesung und Beurkundung der Beschl&#252;sse des Reichstages, dem Reichsabschied. Der letzte dieser Reichsabschiede war der J&#252;ngste Reichsabschied (recessus imperii novissimus) aus dem Jahre 1653/54. Dieser Reichstag in Regensburg hatte die Aufgabe, die bei den Friedensverhandlungen von 1648 zur Beendigung des Drei&#223;igj&#228;hrigen Krieges nicht behandelten Themen zu beraten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Permanenz des Immerw&#228;hrenden Reichstags nach 1663 wurde nie formell beschlossen, war aber in den Beschl&#252;ssen des Westf&#228;lischen Friedens angelegt, woraus sich allm&#228;hlich die Permanenz des Reichstages entwickelte. Dieser Reichstag entwickelte sich aber nach Meinung heutiger Historiker niemals zu einem Parlament oder einer st&#228;ndischen Volksvertretung. Stattdessen war und blieb er immer die Vertretungsinstitution der Kurf&#252;rsten, der f&#252;rstlichen und nicht-f&#252;rstlichen Reichsst&#228;nde. Der Immerw&#228;hrende Reichstag entwickelte sich aufgrund seiner Permanenz recht schnell zu einem reinen Gesandtenkongress, auf dem die Reichsst&#228;nde nur sehr selten erschienen.</German>

		<German>[TAB]Nicolaus Copernicus lebte von 1513 bis zu seinem Tode 1543 mit kurzen Unterbrechungen in Frauenburg. Der Mathematiker, welcher als Astronom einer der Begr&#252;nder des heliozentrischen Weltbildes gilt, wirkte als erml&#228;ndischer Domherr und wurde im Dom begraben. Copernicus hat Frauenburg scherzhaft Weiberstadt[6] oder Ginnepolis (altpreussisch ginne), (griechisch: gyne = Frau, polis = Stadt) genannt. Die Nicolaus Copernicus Gesamtausgabe verzeichnet neben einem latinisierten Fraunburgum auch Gynopolis[7], in seinen Handschriften finden sich Eintr&#228;ge wie in Frueburgo Prussiae oder Frueburgo, quam Gynopolim dicere possumus. Der &#228;lteste Turm der Domburg in deren Nordwestecke wird heute "Copernicusturm" genannt, da er dem Gelehrten geh&#246;rte, der dort seine Wohnung und Arbeitsr&#228;ume hatte.

Ein letzter, absoluter Beweis daf&#252;r lie&#223; sich aber bislang nicht erbringen. Im Dom erinnern eine Gedenktafel aus dem 18.

It is the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English, later British and later still (and currently) monarchs of the Commonwealth Realms. It briefly held the status of a cathedral from 1546-1556, and is a Royal Peculiar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Westminster Abbey is governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, as established by Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster and a Royal Peculiar under the personal jurisdiction of the Sovereign. The members of the Chapter are the Dean and four residentiary Canons, together with the Receiver General and Chapter Clerk.

		<German>[TAB]Westminster Abbey (deutsch: Abtei von Westm&#252;nster, Westm&#252;nsterabtei; eigentlich The Collegiate Church of St Peter, Westminster) ist eine Kirche in London. Traditionell werden hier die K&#246;nige von England (sp&#228;ter britische Monarchen) gekr&#246;nt und beigesetzt. Die Stiftskirche des Kollegiatstifts St. Peter, Westminster geh&#246;rt zur Kirche von England, ist aber aufgrund ihrer Funktion keiner Di&#246;zese zugeh&#246;rig, sondern Eigenkirche ("royal peculiar") der britischen Monarchie. Daher wird ihr oberster Geistlicher, der Dekan von Westminster, direkt vom britischen Monarchen berufen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Am heutigen Standort befand sich urspr&#252;nglich die Klosterkirche einer um 750 gegr&#252;ndeten Benediktinerabtei. Wegen ihrer Lage zu der damaligen Stadt trug die Kirche bereits den Namen West Minster (Westm&#252;nster). Die eigentliche Westminster Abbey wurde zwischen 1045 und 1065 unter Eduard dem Bekenner im romanischen Stil erbaut. Nach seiner Heiligsprechung 1065, ein Jahr vor der normannischen Invasion Englands, wurde die Abtei geweiht und der K&#246;nig hier beigesetzt. Die einzige noch erhaltene Abbildung dieser ersten Abtei findet sich auf dem Teppich von Bayeux. Im Jahre 1245 begann Heinrich III. mit dem Bau der heutigen Kirche im Stil der anglofranz&#246;sischen Fr&#252;hgotik. Der untere Teil der Westfassade stammt aus dem 15. Jahrhundert. Die beiden Hauptt&#252;rme dagegen wurden erst zwischen 1722 und 1745 von Christopher Wren, Nicholas Hawksmoor und John James errichtet. In dem dreischiffigen Innenraum sind alle drei Epochen der englischen Gotik vertreten: "Early English", "Decorated" und "Perpendicular".</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Palace of Versailles began life as a hunting lodge constructed at the instructions of King Louix XIII, who enjoyed hunting in the nearby woods. In 1660, his son Louis XIV decided to turn the "chateau" into a palace. Louis XIV took up residence in 1682, and construction on the palace was completed in 1688. During Louis' lifetime this huge, ungainly, and ornate building was not only his residence, but it also housed the royal court and central bureaucracy of France. Versailles is a complex of richly appointed buildings centered in one-and-a-half square miles of fine parkland. It is surrounded by beautiful fountains, statues, and magnificent formal gardens. [PARAGRAPH:2]At the very center of the palace was, of course, Louis' bedroom, a massive and ostentatious room. At the center of the bedroom was the Royal Bed, which was surrounded by a railing, suggesting that the king did indeed hold large audiences while reclining in the bed and needed a way to keep the visitors' fingers from messing up the royal linens. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Hall of Mirrors is another impressive room in Versailles. Over 200 feet in length and 30 feet wide, the hall contains 578 mirrors and 17 ornate windows. On the ceiling Louis had painted 30 pictures showing his many triumphs and the benefits of his rule. [PARAGRAPH:2]While appearing to many a massive exercise in royal excess, Louis had good reason for constructing Versailles; with one stroke he removed the nobility and bureaucracy from the intrigues of Paris and made them more immediately responsible to him. In this way he was able to render the once powerful nobility largely impotent; great families which had once battled each other for the throne of France now found themselves instead intriguing for the privilege of attending Louis' bath. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nonetheless, Versailles was, in fact, an extraordinarily expensive building. It has been estimated that maintaining the palace and its noble denizens consumed 6%% of the entire French national budget. For a comparison, the United States' President's 2006 budget estimates that the US will take in about 2.2 trillion dollars in revenue in 2006. Six percent of that amount is 132 billion dollars. [PARAGRAPH:2]After the French Revolution and the dissolution of the monarchy, Versailles fell into disrepair and disuse. The German Army made the complex its headquarters after defeating France in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. The building remained in decay until the 1960s, when Pierre Verlet conceived the bold idea of refurbishing Versailles to its glory days under Louis XIV. Since then the curators have managed to retrieve many of the original furnishings from across Europe.</English>
		<French>[TAB]A l'origine, le ch&#226;teau de Versailles est un pavillon de chasse construit &#224; la demande du roi Louis XIII qui aime chasser dans les for&#234;ts environnantes. En 1660, son fils, le roi Louis XIV, d&#233;cide de transformer ce pavillon en palais. Louis XIV y &#233;tablit sa r&#233;sidence en 1682 et la construction du ch&#226;teau s'ach&#232;ve en 1688. Pendant le r&#232;gne de Louis XIV, cet immense ch&#226;teau, richement orn&#233; et au style lourd, n'est pas seulement sa r&#233;sidence mais abrite &#233;galement la cour royale et la bureaucratie centrale de France. Versailles est un ensemble de b&#226;timents richement am&#233;nag&#233;s situ&#233; au centre d'un beau parc bois&#233; de 388 ha. Il est entour&#233; d'admirables fontaines, de statues et de magnifiques jardins &#224; la fran&#231;aise. [PARAGRAPH:2]Au centre m&#234;me du ch&#226;teau se situe la chambre de Louis XIV, immense et pr&#233;tentieuse. Au milieu de la chambre se trouve le lit royal, entour&#233; d'une grille, ce qui sugg&#232;re que le roi donnait effectivement de grandes audiences tout en restant au lit et qu'il devait trouver un moyen d'emp&#234;cher les visiteurs de salir les linges royaux en les touchant. [PARAGRAPH:2]La Galerie des Glaces est une autre pi&#232;ce impressionnante &#224; Versailles. S'&#233;tendant sur plus de 60 m de long et 9 m de large, la galerie compte 578 miroirs et 17 fen&#234;tres richement orn&#233;es. Au plafond, Louis XIV a fait peindre 30 sc&#232;nes repr&#233;sentant ses nombreux triomphes et les avanc&#233;es r&#233;alis&#233;es sous son r&#232;gne. [PARAGRAPH:2]Apparaissant pour beaucoup comme une preuve flagrante des exc&#232;s royaux, Louis XIV a n&#233;anmoins de bonnes raisons de construire le ch&#226;teau de Versailles. Il &#233;loigne ainsi la noblesse et la bureaucratie des intrigues de Paris tout en les rendant plus imm&#233;diatement responsables devant lui. La noblesse, autrefois influente, est alors r&#233;duite &#224; l'impuissance tandis que les grandes familles qui se battaient autrefois pour obtenir le tr&#244;ne de France complotent d&#233;sormais pour avoir le privil&#232;ge d'assister au bain de Louis XIV. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le ch&#226;teau de Versailles s'av&#232;re toutefois un b&#226;timent extr&#234;mement on&#233;reux.

Das riesige Geb&#228;ude beherbergte Ludwigs gesamten Hofstaat und die zentrale Verwaltung Frankreichs. Versailles ist ein Geb&#228;udekomplex in einer etwa 4 Quadratkilometer gro&#223;en Parkanlage mit pr&#228;chtigen Brunnen und Statuen. [PARAGRAPH:2]In der Mitte des Palastes befand sich Ludwigs prunkvolles Schlafzimmer. Das k&#246;nigliche Bett war von einem Gel&#228;nder umgeben, das Besucher der k&#246;niglichen Audienzen (die Ludwig nicht selten im Bett abzuhalten pflegte) auf Distanz halten sollte. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der wohl ber&#252;hmteste Raum des Schlosses ist der 60 Meter lange und 9 Meter breite Spiegelsaal mit seinen 578 Spiegeln und 17 verzierten Fenstern. Die 30 Deckenfresken des Spiegelsaals zeigen die Triumphe und Wohltaten des Monarchen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ludwig hatte &#252;brigens einen guten Grund, Versailles zu bauen. Durch die Verlegung des Hofstaates aus Paris in das neue Schloss konnte er den Einfluss des Adels schm&#228;lern und seine eigene Macht festigen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Allerdings war Versailles ein ausgesprochen teures Bauprojekt. Allein die Instandhaltung des Palastes und die Versorgung seiner Bewohner verschlang j&#228;hrlich etwa 6%% der Staatsfinanzen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nach der Franz&#246;sischen Revolution und dem Ende der Monarchie verfiel das Schloss. Nach dem Deutsch-Franz&#246;sischen Krieg in den Jahren 1870/71 wurde Wilhelm I. im Spiegelsaal von Versailles zum Kaiser proklamiert. Der Verfall des Schlosses wurde erst in den 60er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts gestoppt, als Pierre Verlet den k&#252;hnen Plan fasste, Versailles wieder aufzubauen. Seitdem hat das Schloss einen Teil seines alten Glanzes (und viele M&#246;belst&#252;cke aus der Zeit Ludwigs XIV.) zur&#252;ckgewonnen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]La Reggia di Versailles nacque inizialmente come un alloggio per la caccia per ordine di re Luigi XIII, al quale piaceva aggirarsi nei boschi circostanti. Nel 1660, suo figlio Luigi XIV decise di trasformare la "casa gentilizia" in un palazzo. Luigi XIV vi prese residenza nel 1682 e la costruzione dell'edificio venne terminata nel 1688. Questo enorme palazzo non rappresentava solamente la residenza di Luigi XIV, ma fungeva anche da corte reale e da cuore pulsante della burocrazia di Francia. Versailles &#232; un complesso di edifici molto ricchi distribuiti al centro di un enorme parco circondato da bellissime fontane, statue e giardini. [PARAGRAPH:2]Al centro esatto del palazzo si trovava, naturalmente, la stanza di Luigi XIV, un ambiente pomposo e molto ampio: al centro della stanza si trovava il Letto Reale che era circondato da alcune ringhiere; questo dettaglio lascia pensare che il re abbia ricevuto molte persone e che le ringhiere servissero a tenere lontane delle mani dalle stoffe reali. [PARAGRAPH:2]Il salone degli specchi &#232; un altro luogo mozzafiato di Versailles, di 60 metri per 10: in questa stanza sono presenti 578 specchi e 17 finestre ornate; sul soffitto, Luigi XIV fece affrescare dei dipinti che ritraessero i trionfi e i benefici del suo dominio. [PARAGRAPH:2]Malgrado fosse realmente sfarzosa, Luigi aveva avuto una buona ragione per costruire Versailles: in un colpo riusc&#236; ad eliminare la nobilt&#224; e la democrazia dagli intrighi parigini, rendendoli pi&#249; facilmente controllabili da lui. In questo modo riusc&#236; a rendere praticamente impotenti i nobili dell'epoca e le grandi famiglie che lottarono per conquistare il trono di Francia, dando loro il privilegio di una vita pi&#249; agiata. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ci&#242; nonostante, Versailles era a tutti gli effetti una costruzione estremamente costosa: si calcola che le spese necessarie alla manutenzione del palazzo e della nobilt&#224; ammontassero al 6%% dell'intero budget nazionale Francese. Per fare un esempio pratico, il budget presidenziale del 2006 per gli Stati Uniti ammonta a 2,2 mila miliardi di dollari in entrata; il sei per cento rappresenta 132 miliardi di dollari. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dopo la Rivoluzione Francese e la scomparsa della monarchia, Versailles fin&#236; in rovina e non venne pi&#249; utilizzata fino al 1870, quando l'esercito Germanico la utilizz&#242; come quartier generale nella vittoria durante la Guerra Franco-Prussiana del 1870. Il palazzo decadde fino agli anni '60 quando Pierre Verlet concep&#236; l'idea di restaurare e riportare Versailles ai fasti di Luigi XIV. Da allora, i responsabili del progetto sono riusciti a recuperare molti degli arredi originali disseminati in tutta Europa.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]Pressburg Castle is the main castle of Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian), one of the most important forts in medieval Hungary. The massive rectangular building with four corner towers stands on a quite isolated rocky hill of the Little Carpathians directly above the Danube river in the middle of Pozsony.[PARAGRAPH:2]The construction of the current castle of stone started in the 10th century, but it was not finished. Under King Stephen I of Hungary (I. Istv&#225;n, 1000-1038), however, the castle was already one of the central castles of the Kingdom of Hungary. It became the seat of a county (Pozsony county), protected the kingdom against Bohemian (Czech) and German attacks (e.g. in 1030, 1042, 1052, 1108, 1146) and played an important role in throne struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g. struggles after the death of King Stephen I). In 1052 Henry III tried to occupy the castle. However Zothmund a Hungarian soldier, swam to the ships of the invading fleet to drill holes in them, and they were sunk. King Solomon of Hungary had lived here until he was taken to the jail of Nyitra according to Ladislaus I's (I. L&#225;szl&#243;, 1077-1095) order. At the same time the old rampart was modernized and the Church of the St. Savior with a chapter and a church school were added. Stephen III of Hungary (III. Istv&#225;n, 1162-1172) escaped from his enemies to the castle almost 100 years later.[PARAGRAPH:2]The well-fortified Pressburg Castle was among the few castles of the Kingdom of Hungary to be able to withstand Mongol attacks in 1241 and 1242. As a reaction to these attacks, a huge "tower for the protection of the kingdom" was constructed at the castle building in 1245 immediately next to two older palaces. The tower was actually a huge high residential building. In addition, 7 (genuine) square towers were built into the old rampart and a stone wall was added around the castle proper (i.e. the residential building). The biggest of the rampart towers was at the same time a corner tower of the stone wall. Today it is a part of the castle building - it is identical with the present-day "Crown tower", which is the biggest one of today's four towers of the castle building. It was probably built around 1250 when Knights of St. John were active at the castle.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1536 (de facto already in 1531), after the Ottoman Empire had conquered a significant part of present-day Hungary, Pressburg became the capital (seat of the Diet and of central authorities, place of coronations) of the remaining Kingdom of Hungary, which was renamed Royal Hungary and was de facto ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs. Consequently, Pressburg Castle became the most important royal castle and the formal seat of the kings of Royal Hungary (who however resided in Vienna normally). At the same time, from the beginning of the 16th century, Pressburg and its castle had to face various anti-Habsburg uprisings in Royal Hungary. For example, troops of G&#225;bor Bethlen occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621, when it was reconquered by imperial (Austrian) troops, and had the royal crown removed from Pressburg Castle till 1622. Between 1671 and 1677, Pressburg Castle was home to an extraordinary court against the Protestants and participants of anti-Habsburg uprisings. Imre Th&#246;k&#246;ly, the leader of another big anti-Habsburg uprising, failed to conquer the castle in 1682-83.[PARAGRAPH:2]In terms of the castle's functions after 1530, the castle was home to selected participants of Diet meetings (including apartments of the king/emperor, which have been already there since the Gothic reconstruction), to some central authorities of Royal Hungary, the county head of Pozsony etc., to the apartment of the Governor of Royal Hungary (usually a brother of the emperor), and since 1552, the crown jewels were deposited here as well - in what is today known as the Crown Tower. Initial and final meetings of the Diet took place in the castle too.</English>

In addition, 7 (genuine) square towers were built into the old rampart and a stone wall was added around the castle proper (i.e. the residential building). The biggest of the rampart towers was at the same time a corner tower of the stone wall. Today it is a part of the castle building - it is identical with the present-day "Crown tower", which is the biggest one of today's four towers of the castle building. It was probably built around 1250 when Knights of St. John were active at the castle.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1536 (de facto already in 1531), after the Ottoman Empire had conquered a significant part of present-day Hungary, Pressburg became the capital (seat of the Diet and of central authorities, place of coronations) of the remaining Kingdom of Hungary, which was renamed Royal Hungary and was de facto ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs. Consequently, Pressburg Castle became the most important royal castle and the formal seat of the kings of Royal Hungary (who however resided in Vienna normally). At the same time, from the beginning of the 16th century, Pressburg and its castle had to face various anti-Habsburg uprisings in Royal Hungary. For example, troops of G&#225;bor Bethlen occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621, when it was reconquered by imperial (Austrian) troops, and had the royal crown removed from Pressburg Castle till 1622. Between 1671 and 1677, Pressburg Castle was home to an extraordinary court against the Protestants and participants of anti-Habsburg uprisings. Imre Th&#246;k&#246;ly, the leader of another big anti-Habsburg uprising, failed to conquer the castle in 1682-83.[PARAGRAPH:2]In terms of the castle's functions after 1530, the castle was home to selected participants of Diet meetings (including apartments of the king/emperor, which have been already there since the Gothic reconstruction), to some central authorities of Royal Hungary, the county head of Pozsony etc., to the apartment of the Governor of Royal Hungary (usually a brother of the emperor), and since 1552, the crown jewels were deposited here as well - in what is today known as the Crown Tower. Initial and final meetings of the Diet took place in the castle too.</French>

Jahrhundert errichtet. Kaiser Sigismund von Luxemburg lie&#223; die Burg um 1430 zu einer Festung im gotischen Stil ausbauen. Kaiser Ferdinand I. ordnete den Umbau im Renaissance-Stil an; um 1650 erhielt die Burg ihr heutiges barockes Aussehen. Kaiserin Maria Theresia erhob die Burg 1740 zu ihrer ungarischen Residenz. Im Mai 1811 brannte die Burg bis auf die Grundmauern nieder. W&#228;hrend mehr als 140 Jahre erhoben sich lediglich Ruinen &#252;ber der Stadt. Von 1953 bis 1968 wurde die Burg originalgetreu wiederaufgebaut, heute dient sie als Museum und f&#252;r repr&#228;sentative Zwecke.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Pressburg Castle is the main castle of Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian), one of the most important forts in medieval Hungary.

Under King Stephen I of Hungary (I. Istv&#225;n, 1000-1038), however, the castle was already one of the central castles of the Kingdom of Hungary. It became the seat of a county (Pozsony county), protected the kingdom against Bohemian (Czech) and German attacks (e.g. in 1030, 1042, 1052, 1108, 1146) and played an important role in throne struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g. struggles after the death of King Stephen I). In 1052 Henry III tried to occupy the castle. However Zothmund a Hungarian soldier, swam to the ships of the invading fleet to drill holes in them, and they were sunk. King Solomon of Hungary had lived here until he was taken to the jail of Nyitra according to Ladislaus I's (I. L&#225;szl&#243;, 1077-1095) order. At the same time the old rampart was modernized and the Church of the St. Savior with a chapter and a church school were added. Stephen III of Hungary (III.

The palace was a setting for state occasions and royal entertainments and is a major tourist attraction today. The name directly translates as "Cannongate Palace", from the palace being named after a nearby, now lost gate.[PARAGRAPH:2]The initial construction started in 1459, ordered by Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Byzantine Constantinople. The palace is a complex made up of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings. At the height of its existence as a royal residence, the palace was home to as many as 4,000 people, formerly covering a larger area with a long shoreline. The complex has been expanded over the centuries, with many renovations such as after the 1509 earthquake and 1665 fire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Topkapi Palace gradually lost its importance at the end of the 17th century, as the Sultans preferred to spend more time in their new palaces along the Bosporus. In 1853, Sultan Abd&#252;l Mecid I decided to move the court to the newly built Dolmabah&#231;e Palace, the first European-style palace in the city. Some functions, such as the imperial treasury, the library, mosque and mint, were retained though.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1921, Topkapi Palace was transformed by government decree on April 3, 1924 into a museum of the imperial era.

		<German>[TAB]Der Topkapi-Palast (im Deutschen auch Topkapi-Serail, w&#246;rtlich "Kanonentor-Palast") in Istanbul war jahrhundertelang der Wohn- und Regierungssitz der Sultane sowie das Verwaltungszentrum des Osmanischen Reiches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mit dem Bau wurde kurz nach der Eroberung Konstantinopels (1453) durch Sultan Mehmed II. begonnen. Zun&#228;chst ordnete er die Errichtung des Palastes auf dem heutigen Beyazitplatz (Beyazit Meydani) an, entschied sich dann aber f&#252;r die heute Sarayburnu genannte Landspitze zwischen Goldenem Horn und Marmarameer. Dabei wurden Teile des byzantinischen Mangana-Palastes &#252;berbaut. Ihr heutiges Aussehen erhielt die Anlage durch umfangreiche Renovierungen und Erweiterungen bis zum Anfang des 18. Jahrhunderts. Seit Mehmed II. residierten alle osmanischen Herrscher im Topkapi-Palast, bis Sultan Abd&#252;lmecid I. im Jahre 1856 das neue Dolmabah&#231;e Sarayi auf der anderen Seite des Goldenen Horns am Ufer des Bosporus bezog. Beide Pal&#228;ste sind heute Museen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Palast besteht nicht aus einem einzelnen, sondern getreu der t&#252;rkischen Tradition aus mehreren Geb&#228;uden in einem gro&#223;en Garten. Mit einer Fl&#228;che von &#252;ber 69 Hektar und bis zu 5000 Bewohnern war der Palast eine eigene Stadt. Man nannte ihn anfangs Saray-i Ced&#238;d-i &#194;mire oder Yeni Saray /,Neuer Palast', bevor sich im 18. Jahrhundert der Name Topkapi Sarayi durchsetzte, der sich von der palasteigenen Kanonengie&#223;erei ableitete.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Palast ist in vier H&#246;fe unterteilt, die jeweils durch eigene Tore erreicht werden. Mit seiner Lage auf einer Landspitze bietet er eine beispiellose Panoramasicht auf Istanbul, den Bosporus und das Goldene Horn.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Lighthouse of Genoa (Italian: Faro di Genova, but simply called Lanterna), is the main lighthouse for the city's port. Besides being an important aid to night navigation in the vicinity, the tower serves as a symbol for the City of Genoa, and is one of the oldest standing structures of its kind in the world. It is built on the hill of San Benigno at some little distance from the Sampierdarena neighborhood. At 249 feet (76 m) it is the world's second tallest "traditional lighthouse" built of masonry. It is constructed in two square portions, each one capped by a terrace; the whole structure is crowned by a lantern from which the light is shone.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first tower at this location, a structure formed of three crenellated towers, was built, most sources say, around 1128, although at least one states that it was built in 1161. At the time it sat close to the main coastal road, called the Via di Francia, which more recent documents describe as passing between it and the sea. When it was constructed the tower was fairly far from the city; it was only in the seventeenth century that it became part of the so-called "Cerchia Seicentesca", part of the seicento city walls of Genoa. It has remained a part of the system until today.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dried pieces of erica and juniper wood were used to fuel the signal fire in its early years; for upkeep, navigators who used the port were expected to pay a tax upon their approach to the city. The tower also played a part, early in its career, in the ongoing feud between the Guelphs and Ghibellines; during one battle, the Ghibellines damaged it considerably during an attempt to dislodge a group of Guelphs who had taken refuge inside. In 1318 and again in 1321, it was decided to dig a defensive trench around the tower, the better to protect it from damage in battle. In 1326 the first oil-based lantern, whose fire was fed by olive oil, was added to the structure, so that incoming vessels could better distinguish the signal fire upon approach. For the same reason, in 1340 the tower was painted with the coat of arms of the city, the better to serve as a distinctive daymark. In around 1400 the lighthouse was further converted for use as a prison; among the hostages therein accommodated were the king of Cyprus, James II, and his wife.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1405 the priests who were responsible for the upkeep of the lighthouse placed on its cupola a fish and a golden cross to serve as symbols of Christianity. During the cinquecento the structure was heavily damaged again, this time by friendly fire from the Genovese against the French. Thirty years later, in 1543, the tower was once again reconstructed, assuming the form in which it may still be seen today.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1449 one of the keepers of the lighthouse was listed as Antonio Colombo, uncle of explorer Christopher Columbus.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower was shelled during the bombardment of Genoa by the French in 1684; the windows which were damaged were replaced on the orders of Louis XIV in 1692. In 1778 construction began on a new lighting system designed to counteract damage done to the lighting apparatus over several centuries of use. In 1840 a rotating Fresnel lens was installed; the system was formally inaugurated in January 1841. It was modified up until the end of the century in order to increase its capability; the entire lighthouse was modernised again in 1913, but the electrification was poorly done, and had to be refitted in 1936.

		<English>[TAB]The Venetian Arsenal (Italian: Arsenale di Venezia) is a shipyard and naval depot that played a leading role in Venetian empire-building. It was one of the most important areas of Venice, lying in the Castello sestiere.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the eighth century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. It definitely existed by the early thirteenth century and is mentioned in Dante's Inferno. The name probably comes from Arabic Dar al Sina_a ("Dockyard") and the concept was clearly Islamic as much as Byzantine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Initially the state dockyard worked merely to maintain naval ships built privately, but in 1320 the Arsenal Nuovo was built, much larger than the original. It enabled all the state's navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal incidentally became an important centre for rope manufacture, while housing for the arsenal workers grew up outside its walls.[PARAGRAPH:2]Venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the Roman hull-first practice. The new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early sixteenth century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly-built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution.[PARAGRAPH:2]The staff of the Arsenal also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms against the Genoese a few years later. Improvements in handguns led to their muzzle velocity (and therefore their ability to penetrate armor) exceeding that of the crossbow. The Venetian condottieri leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal's new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, was built in about 1460 and was the first Classical revival structure to be built in Venice. It was perhaps built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, is notable for having been defaced with lengthy runic inscriptions carved in the eleventh century by Scandinavian mercenary soldiers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Arsenal Novissimo was begun in 1473. It enabled the creation of a system similar to an assembly line, in which hulls were constructed in the newer areas of the Arsenal before being fitted out in the old Arsenal.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the late sixteenth century, the Arsenal's designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The most impressive was the galleass, already used at Lepanto, and developed from the old merchanting "great galley". It was huge, with sails as well as oars, and was virtually a floating fortress, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant "round ship". It was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the frequent lee shores of the Dalmatian coast.[PARAGRAPH:2]Significant parts of the Arsenal were destroyed under Napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the Arsenal's present use as a naval base. It is also used as a research centre, an exhibition venue during the Venice Biennale and is home to a historic boat preservation centre.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Arsenal ist der Name der Schiffswerft, des Zeughauses und der Flottenbasis der ehemaligen Republik Venedig.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Bau des Arsenals wurde unter dem Dogen Ordelaf Falier ab 1104 begonnen. Das Grundst&#252;ck bestand aus zwei sumpfigen Inseln im Stadtteil Castello. Diese Werft, die als gr&#246;&#223;ter Produktionsbetrieb Europas vor dem Zeitalter der Industrialisierung betrachtet werden kann, wurde zum Vorbild f&#252;r andere Marinearsenale in Europa. Das Gebiet umfasst heute 32 Hektar, ein Zehntel des historischen Zentrums von Venedig.Im Zuge des Aufstiegs Venedigs zur europ&#228;ischen Seemacht wurde das Arsenal mehrmals erweitert: im Jahre 1325 durch das Arsenale nuovo, 1475 durch das Arsenale nuovissimo. 1539 wurde das Becken f&#252;r die Galeassen fertiggestellt, die bis zu 1.000 Bruttoregistertonnen und eine Besatzung von 400 Mann hatten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Arsenal enthielt neben den Schiffsbecken, den Schreinereien, den Kalfateranlagen und einer langen Seilhalle, in der die Schiffstaue gedreht wurden, auch Erz- und Gie&#223;h&#252;tten sowie Pulverlager und das Waffendepot, was eine strenge &#220;berwachung der Belegschaft durch die venezianische Sicherheitspolizei n&#246;tig machte. Das Arsenal arbeitete au&#223;erordentlich effizient. Bereits Im 14. Jahrhundert erfolgte die Produktion der Galeeren in streng rationalisierten Arbeitsabl&#228;ufen. Jedes Handelsschiff war so konstruiert, dass es in k&#252;rzester Zeit zu einem Kriegsschiff umgebaut werden konnte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Bestandteile f&#252;r die Galeeren waren genormt, wurden vorgefertigt und im Depot gelagert, so dass in k&#252;rzester Zeit 25 Schiffe einsatzfertig gemacht werden konnten. Im Krieg gegen die T&#252;rken wurden im Arsenal im Jahre 1570 innerhalb von zwei Wochen 100 Galeeren gebaut. Im Arsenal konnten bis zu 30.000 Leute arbeiten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Diese Effizienz war nur durch eine straffe Organisation m&#246;glich. Leiter des Arsenals (capo supremo) war ein Angeh&#246;riger des Adelsstandes. Die Aufsicht aus&#252;benden Abteilungsleiter, oder auch patroni dell&#180; Arsenale genannt, wohnten in drei palazetti, die Paradiso, Purgatorio (Fegefeuer) und Inferno (H&#246;lle) hie&#223;en. Jede Abteilung hatte eine Vielzahl von Handwerkern wie Schiffszimmerleute, Pecher (Kalfaterer), Mastenkonstrukteure, Segelmacher, Schmiede, Gie&#223;ereiarbeiter sowie Verantwortliche f&#252;r das Schie&#223;pulver und die Bewaffnung zur Verf&#252;gung. Abteilungsleiter und Angeh&#246;rige von Spezialberufen wurden f&#252;rstlich entlohnt, um ein eventuelles Abwandern zur feindlichen Konkurrenz zu verhindern. Auch wurde den Arbeitern Wohnraum zur Verf&#252;gung gestellt und zwar in der sogenannten Marinaressa, einem Geb&#228;udekomplex der zwischen der Via Garibaldi und der Riva dei Sette Martiri liegt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das Holz zum Bau der Schiffe kam entweder aus Istrien oder dem Cadore.</German>

One of the city's most striking landmarks, it is a high, cone-capped cylinder that dominates the skyline and affords a panoramic vista of Old Istanbul and its environment.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower was built as Christea Turris (Tower of Christ) in 1348 during an expansion of the Genoese colony in Constantinople. It was the apex of the fortifications surrounding the Genoese citadel of Galata. The current tower should not be confused with the old Tower of Galata, an original Byzantine tower named Megalos Pyrgos (English: Great Tower) which controlled the northern end of the massive sea chain that closed the entrance to the Golden Horn. That tower was on a different site and was largely destroyed in 1203, during the Fourth Crusade of 1202 - 1204.</English>

The building is considered to be the symbol of the city, and is even used on the city's flag.[PARAGRAPH:2]Construction of the building began in the early reign of the Anatolian Seljuq Sultan Ala ad-Din Kay Qubadh I and was completed in 1226. The sultan brought the accomplished architect Ebu Ali Reha from Aleppo, Syria to Alanya to complete the building. The octagonal red brick tower protects the Tersane (shipyard) which dates from 1221.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name derives from the more red color brick he used in its construction. The building itself is 33 m high and 12.5 m wide. It remains one of the finest examples of medieval military architecture, and is the best preserved Seljuk building in the city. Like many buildings in the city, the Tower flies a Turkish Flag from its crenelations.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Vilnius Castle Complex is a group of cultural and historic structures on the left bank of the Neris River, near its confluence with the Vilnia River. The buildings, which evolved between the 10th and 18th centuries, were one of Lithuania's major defensive structures. One part of the castle complex, which was built on a hilltop, is known as the Upper Castle, while Gediminas' Tower is the only remaining part of the Upper Castle.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first fortifications were built of wood, and since about the 13th century the hilltop has been surrounded by stone walls with towers. During the rule of Gediminas, Vilnius was designated as the capital city; in 1323, the castle was improved and expanded. The first brick castle was completed in 1409 by Grand Duke Vytautas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pagan Lithuania waged war with the Christian Orders for more than two centuries. The Orders were seeking to conquer Lithuania, stating that their motivation was the conversion of pagan Lithuanians to Catholicism. As Vilnius evolved into one of the most important cities in the state, it became a primary military target. The Castle Complex was attacked by the Teutonic Order in 1365, 1375, 1377, 1383, 1390, 1392, 1394 and 1402, but was never completely taken.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a major fire in 1419, Vytautas initiated a reconstruction of the Upper Castle, along with the fortification of other buildings in the complex (in Gothic style), and it served an important role in the following centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the 16th century, the Upper Castle was not maintained, and it suffered from neglect. It was used as a fortress for the last time during the invasion of the Russians in 1655, when for the first time in Lithuanian history, a foreign army captured the entire complex. Even though the Polish-Lithuanian army managed to recapture Vilnius and the castles six years later, the Upper Castle stood abandoned and was not reconstructed afterwards.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, the remaining Gediminas' Tower is a major state and historic symbol of the city of Vilnius and of the nation itself. It is depicted on the national currency, the litas, and is mentioned in numerous Lithuanian patriotic poems and folk songs. The Flag of Lithuania was re-hoisted atop the tower on October 7, 1988, during the independence movement that was finalized by the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990. A reconstruction of the Royal Palace of Lithuania was completed in 2009, and is located near the base of the hill upon which Gediminas' Tower stands.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Torre del Oro (English: "Gold Tower") is a dodecagonal military watchtower in Seville, southern Spain, built by the Almohad dynasty in order to control access to Seville via the Guadalquivir river.[PARAGRAPH:2]Constructed in the first third of the 13th century, the tower served as a prison during the Middle Ages and as a secure enclosure for the protection of precious metals periodically brought by the fleet of the Indies, another possible origin for the tower's name.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is one of two anchor points for a large chain that would have been able to block the river. The other anchor-point has since been demolished or disappeared, possibly from collapsing during the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake. The chain was used in the city's defense against the Castilian fleet under Ramon de Bonifaz in 1248 Reconquista. Bonifaz broke the river defenses and isolated Seville from Triana. The besieged Muslim city soon surrendered to the Christian forces.</English>

The Duomo, as it is ordinarily called, was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th century Gothic Revival facade by Emilio De Fabris.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral complex, located in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile. The three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting the region of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches, and until development of new structural materials in the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed.</English>

It is located approximately one kilometre off the country's north-western coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon River near Avranches. The population of the island is 41, as of 2006. The island has been a strategic point holding fortifications since ancient times, and since the 8th century AD it became the seat of the Saint-Michel monastery, from which it draws the name. The Mont-Saint-Michel and its bay are part of the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. More than 3,000,000 people visit it each year.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mont Saint-Michel was used in the 6th and 7th centuries as an Armorican stronghold of Romano-Breton culture and power, until it was ransacked by the Franks, thus ending the trans-channel culture that had stood since the departure of the Romans in AD 460. Before the construction of the first monastic establishment in the 8th century, the island was called "monte tombe". According to legend, the Archangel Michael appeared to St. Aubert, bishop of Avranches, in 708 and instructed him to build a church on the rocky islet. Aubert repeatedly ignored the angel's instruction, until Michael burned a hole in the bishop's skull with his finger.</English>

The east wing of the two-storey church was originally constructed in the late 10th or early 11th century, then the central wing was added in the 13th century under the Second Bulgarian Empire, the whole building being finished with a further expansion to the west in the middle of the 19th century. A total of 89 scenes with 240 human images are depicted on the walls of the church.[PARAGRAPH:2]Besides the first layer of 11th-12th-century frescoes, of which only fragments are preserved, and the famous second layer of murals from 1259, the church also has a smaller number of later frescoes from the 14th and 16th-17th centuries, as well as from 1882. The church owes its world fame mainly to its frescoes from 1259. They form a second layer over the paintings from earlier centuries and represent one of the most complete and well-preserved monuments of medieval art in the Balkans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Eighteen scenes in the narthex depict the life of Saint Nicholas. The painter here drew certain aspects of contemporary lifestyle. In The Miracle at Sea, the ship and the sailors' hats recall the Venetian fleet. The portraits of the patrons of the church - Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, as well as those of Bulgarian tsar Constantine Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina, are thought to be among the most impressive and lifelike frescoes in the church, and are located on the north wall of the church.</English>

The mosque is popularly known as the Blue Mosque: Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque's interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque's five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes. It was built between 1609 and 1616, during the rule of Ahmed I. Like many other mosques, it also comprises a tomb of the founder, a madrasah and a hospice.[PARAGRAPH:2]The design of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque is the culmination of two centuries of both Ottoman mosque and Byzantine church development. It incorporates some Byzantine elements of the neighboring Hagia Sophia with traditional Islamic architecture and is considered to be the last great mosque of the classical period. The architect has ably synthesized the ideas of his master Mimar Sinan, aiming for overwhelming size, majesty and splendour.[PARAGRAPH:2]At its lower levels and at every pier, the interior of the mosque is lined with more than 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles, made at Iznik (the ancient Nicaea) in more than fifty different tulip designs. At gallery level their design becomes flamboyant with representations of flowers, fruit and cypresses, while there are more than 200 stained glass windows in the mosque. The upper levels of the interior are dominated by blue paint.</English>

The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Selim II, and was built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1569 and 1575. It was considered by Sinan to be his masterpiece and is one of the highest achievements of Islamic architecture.[PARAGRAPH:2]Selimiye Mosque was built at the peak of Ottoman military and cultural power. As the empire started to grow, the emperor had found an immediate urge to centralize the city. Sinan was asked to help to construct the Selimiye Mosque, making the mosque distinctive and served the purpose of centralizing the city. In this mosque he employed an octagonal supporting system that is created through eight pillars incised in a square shell of walls. The four semi domes at the corners of the square behind the arches that spring from the pillars, are intermediary sections between the huge encompassing dome (31.25 metres diameter with spherical profile) and the walls. The beauty resulting from the conformity of geometric shapes engulfed in each other was the culmination of Sinan's lifelong search for a unified interior space.[PARAGRAPH:2]The interior of the mosque received great recognitions from its clean, spare lines in the structure itself. With the monumental exteriors proclaiming the wealth and power of the Ottoman Empire, the plain symmetrical interiors reminded the sultans should always provide a humble and faithful heart in order to connect and communicate with God. To enter, it was to forget the power, determination, wealth and technical mastery of the Ottoman Empire. Lights were seeped through multitude of tiny windows, and the interchanging of the weak light and dark was interpreted as the insignificance of humanity. The Selimiye did not only amaze the public with the extravagant symmetrical exterior, it had also astonished the people with the plain symmetrical interior for it had summarized all Ottoman architectural thinking in one simple pure form.</English>

Associated with Al-Azhar Mosque in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university and is renowned as "Sunni Islam's most prestigious university".[PARAGRAPH:2]Founded in 970 or 972 as a centre of Islamic learning, it is one of the relics of the Isma'ili Shia Fatimid dynasty era of Egypt. Its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law in detail, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. It was one of the first universities in the world, and the only one in the Arabic world to survive as a modern university including secular subjects in the curriculum. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Studies began at Al-Azhar in the month of Ramadan, 975. The Jami'ah (Madrasa) had faculties in Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic. The Fatimids gave attention to the philosophical studies at the time when rulers in other countries declared those who were engaged in philosophical pursuits as apostates and heretics. The Greek thought found a warm reception with the Fatimids who expanded the boundaries of such studies. They paid much attention to philosophy and gave support to everyone who was known for being engaged in the study of any branch of philosophy. The Fatimid Caliph invited many scholars from nearby countries and paid much attention to college books on various branches of knowledge and in gathering the finest writing on various subjects and this in order to encourage scholars and to uphold the cause of knowledge. Most of these books were destroyed by Saladin though, when he converted Al-Azhar to a Shafi'ite Sunni center of learning.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum: a wide range of secular faculties were added for the first time, such as business, economics, science, pharmacy, medicine, engineering and agriculture. In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students. As of 1996, over 4000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the University.[PARAGRAPH:2]Its library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives. In May 2005, Al-Azhar launched a project to eventually publish online access to the library's entire rare manuscripts collection, comprising about seven million pages of material.</English>

The Great Mosque of Kairouan is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa; its perimeter is almost equal to 405 metres (1,328 feet). This space contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Aghlabids (9th century), huge works gave the mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and repopulate increasingly. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. With the decline of the city of Kairouan from the mid-11th century (The Banu Hilal tribes so utterly destroyed Kairouan in 1057 that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant), the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis and other major cities in the Maghreb.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Koutoubia Mosque or Kutubiyya Mosque is the largest mosque in Marrakesh, Morocco, located in the southwest medina quarter of Marrakesh. The mosque is ornamented with curved windows, a band of ceramic inlay, pointed merlons, and decorative arches; it has a large plaza with gardens, and is floodlit at night. The minaret, 77 metres (253 ft) in height, includes a spire and orbs. It was completed under the reign of the Berber Almohad Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur (1184 to 1199), and has inspired other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower of Rabat.[PARAGRAPH:2]The city of Marrakesh was captured by the Almohads after the death of the Almoravid leader Ali ibn Yusuf in 1147. The Almohads did not want any trace of religious monuments built by the Almoravids, their staunch enemies, as they considered them heretics. Abd-al-Mu'min, who won the territory, was responsible for building the first Koutoubiya mosque on the grounds of the former palace of Ali ibn Yusuf in the southwest quarter of the medina. This first mosque was started between 1147 and 1154 and completed in 1157.[PARAGRAPH:2]A second mosque was built under the Almohad Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur, as it was realized halfway through construction that the initial mosque's mihrab (prayer niche) was misaligned and not oriented towards Mecca. In some opinions the second mosque was already undergoing construction when the first mosque was completed. The second mosque was built identical to the first except for its orientation. The layout, architectural designs, inscriptions, dimensions and materials used for construction were all the same. The minaret plan and design remained the same in both buildings. It was completed by the 1190s, though reported completion dates vary between 1190 and 1199. The first mosque eventually deteriorated. It is apparent that the second mosque was not built as an alternative to the first one, as the two mosques shared the same site for 30 years before the first mosque became derelict. Funnily, while in the first mosque the orientation of the mihrab was 5 degrees out of alignment with respect to the direction towards Mecca, in the second mosque the orientation was 10 degrees off, thus actually further out of alignment with Mecca than the first mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Koutoubia Mosque and tower constitute the oldest and most complete structure of the Almohad period. The mosque was followed by two other structures built on the same pattern, the Tour Hassan in Rabat and the Giralda in Seville, Spain. This structure thus became the forerunner of Moroccan-Andalusian architecture. Non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque; however, they are permitted to visit the Tin Mal Mosque, built on the lines of Koutoubia Mosque.[PARAGRAPH:2]The mosque is made of red stone, formerly plastered, and has six rooms in succession, one above the other. It was designed so as to prevent anyone gazing in from the minaret to the harems of the king. Even in the modern day, such restrictions are enforced by blocking Google Earth access to Moroccans.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Built between 548 and 565, Saint Catherine's Monastery is one of the oldest working Christian monasteries in the world. It lies on the Sinai Peninsula, at the mouth of a gorge at the foot of Mount Sinai, near the town of Saint Catherine, Egypt. The monastery is controlled by the autonomous Church of Sinai, part of the wider Eastern Orthodox Church, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[PARAGRAPH:2]The site contains the world's oldest continually operating library, possessing many unique books including the Syriac Sinaiticus and, until 1859, the Codex Sinaiticus (a manuscript dating from the 4th Century, at the time the oldest almost completely preserved manuscript of the Bible). The monastery library preserves the second largest collection of early codices and manuscripts in the world, outnumbered only by the Vatican Library. It contains Greek, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Hebrew, Georgian, Aramaic and Caucasian Albanian texts.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to tradition, Catherine of Alexandria was a Christian martyr sentenced to death on the breaking wheel. When this failed to kill her, she was beheaded, and angels took her remains to Mount Sinai. Around the year 800, monks from the Sinai Monastery found her remains.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although it is commonly known as Saint Catherine's, the monastery's full official name is the Sacred Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai. The patronal feast of the monastery is the Feast of the Transfiguration. The monastery has become a favorite site of pilgrimage.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A palace is the home of a head of state or other high-ranking public figure. Many palaces are now put to other uses such as parliaments or museums. Heads of State, especially monarchs, usually spend some weeks each year in other palaces that are not their primary residence.

A few examples are the Russian Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, the Chinese Summer Palace in Beijing, and the Kucuksu Summer Palace in Istanbul.</English>

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with ironic, satiric or burlesque intent.

Bis zu Jakob I. nutzen alle englischen K&#246;nige und K&#246;niginnen den Tower zeitweilig zum Aufenthalt. Es war &#252;blich, dass der Monarch vor dem Tag seiner Kr&#246;nung im Tower &#252;bernachtete und dann in feierlichem Zug durch die Stadt nach Westminster ritt. Als St&#252;tzpunkt der britischen Monarchie im historischen Zentrum Londons ist der Tower eng mit der britischen Geschichte verbunden.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]The most famous Royal Dungeon is located in England. Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress, more commonly known as the Tower of London (and historically as The Tower), is a historic fortress and scheduled monument in central London, on the north bank of the River Thames. It is located within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and is separated from the eastern edge of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It is the oldest building used by the British government.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Tower of London is often identified with the White Tower, the original stark square fortress built by William the Conqueror in 1078. However, the tower as a whole is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat.[PARAGRAPH:2]The tower's primary function was a fortress, a royal palace, and a prison (particularly for high status and royal prisoners, such as the Princes in the Tower and the future Queen Elizabeth I). This last use has led to the phrase "sent to the Tower" (meaning "imprisoned"). It has also served as a place of execution and torture, an armoury, a treasury, a zoo, the Royal Mint, a public records office, an observatory, and since 1303, the home of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom.</Italian>

Classic examples of epics include Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey."[PARAGRAPH:2]A "national epic" celebrates the exploits of an entire country. One of the earliest examples is the "Shahnama," (The Book of Kings), a Persian literary classic written around 1000 AD. The Shahnama chronicles the history of Persia from mythological pre-history through the reign of Khosrau II (590-628). The work contains over 60,000 couplets and is still read and enjoyed by modern readers.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is possible that the age of the literary epic is dead, and that in the future all such stories will be done as "made for TV movies."

		<English>[TAB]A triumphal arch is a structure in the shape of a monumental archway, usually built to celebrate a victory in war. The arch is invariably a free-standing structure, quite separate from city gates or walls. In its simplest form a triumphal arch consists of two pillars connected by an arch, crowned with a superstructure or attic on which a statue or commemorative inscriptions might be mounted. More elaborate triumphal arches have flanking subsidiary archways, typically a pair. Famous arches include the Arch of Titus in Rome and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.</English>

Dans sa forme la plus simple, l'arc de triomphe se compose de deux piliers reli&#233;s par un arc et surmont&#233;s d'un entablement ou d'un attique sur lequel peuvent &#234;tre ajout&#233;es une statue ou des inscriptions comm&#233;moratives.
