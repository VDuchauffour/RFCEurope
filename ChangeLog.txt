Welcome to Rhye's and Fall of Europe, a mod based on the incredibly popular original Rhye's and Fall of Civilizations (RFC).
If you've played RFC before, all the familiar elements are here: stability, plagues, dynamic rises, barbarian uprisings, Unique Powers, Unique Historical Victories,
and uniquely customized parameters designed to simulate history while allowing you the freedom to change it.
In order to simulate a time period (500 - 1800 AD) and region in greater depth we've created a new huge map of Europe with new resources and new terrain.
We've also added new civilizations, a new tech tree, new units, new civics, new corporations, new buildings and wonders.
Religion, so critical in this period, has been made much more important. Faith points, a new concept, provide unique benefits for each religion based on how pious your civilization is. 

The mod is still in development. We are looking for feedback on the gameplay experience and the level of difficulty of the Unique Historical Victories.
Please post your thoughts in our forum at http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=386

You can find more details in the Manual and Reference folders in the mod. A copy of the manual is also available at http://rfceurope.sourceforge.net/

Changes for RFCE 1.1:
(to-be-released: ???)
	
	General changes:
		- Protestant Church School requires Protestantism as a state religion
		- Revised AI distance settings for city placement - territory coverage should be better now
		- A couple changes and fixes in the settler maps in light of these AI distance changes
		- Improved UHV counter for the Polish 3rd UHV - by HolyHandGrenade
		- Added a Spawn map in the Reference folder (with all civs' spawn areas and spawn dates, and the indy/barb cities) - by HolyHandGrenade
		- Olive plantation gives 1 food but one less commerce; unimproved grapes already give 1 food; additional 1 commerce from improved Silk
		- As of revision 949, the russian version is a separate download. An add-on to the mod
			The main reason behind this is the need of the original special characters of Civ IV (more or less a Special ASCII HTML Character Code, instead of a russian one)
			This will enable us to use such characters on the city name map too: âáäéëíöüúó
			The character set is close enough to this: http://www.yellowpipe.com/yis/tools/ASCII-HTML-Characters/index.php
			Actually we could have those extra characters before, but only in the civilopedia and other texts
			Now we can have civ-specific names everywhere, including everything that appear on the map too
			Specifically: UUs, UBs, civ specific Great People names, and most importantly: city names
			Instead of Russian, Portuguese is being added as the 6th language, as it uses the same gamefont set as the other main languages
		- Added option in the dll for stable and unstable text icons. Can be referenced with [ICON_STABLE] and [ICON_UNSTABLE] in the XML files
		- First part of the inquisition updates: base code for chooseable religion on persecution
	
	Map and province changes:
		- Atlantic Access near Sevilla
		- Forest near Antioch, so AI Arabia will have Damascus as it's first city -> it will be the holy city of Islam
	
	XML/text updates:
		- New Dawn of Man text for Hungary, Kiev, Cordoba. Minor fixes in most of the other texts
		- Small updates in the reference files
		- Added a couple Spanish translations by mijamobu
		- Added many Italian translations by Fede14
		- Huge XML cleanup and reorganization
		- German translations by HolyHandGrenade

		- New flag for Germany by zwei833
		- New button for Germany, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Venice, improved button for almost all other civs
		- Separate, uncompressed dds atlas for civilizations - better button quality
		- Main map icons for great general points and stability
	
	Balance:
		- Separated Mongol and Seljuk spawn: very hard on the human player, easier for the AI. Additional minor tweaks in a few other barbarian spawns
		- Lowered the number of extra units you get on initial war for most civs
		- Small changes to a couple civs initially spawned units too - mostly increasing defensive units for the AI
		- Lots of smallish base balance changes for most of the civs (both growth and production modifiers)
		- Indy Augsburg starts with an additional archer - so it won't be razed so often by barbs before the German spawn
		- Belograd (Alba Iulia) spawns in 880 AD, changed to be an indy city instead of barbarian, and starts with 2 archers instead of 1 crossbowman
		- A couple additional starting units for Poland and Lithuania
		- Small changes in the starting techs. Poland got an additional tech, many civs got one less
	
	Bugfixes:
		- Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish and Lithuanian cottage/hamlet/village/town improvement art
		- UHV counter display bug for Portugal and France
		- Workboat is no longer a military unit
		- Fixed bug with Arabian UP when Judaism is the state religion
		- Fixed Jewish Quarter counting bug in the Polish 3rd UHV when Kazimierz is built - by HolyHandGrenade
		- Fixed small bug in stability counting when using Divine Monarchy and Paganism civics together - by HolyHandGrenade
		- Removed the UHV check for the old Spanish 3rd UHV (conquer protestant cities). It was possible to trigger both 3rd UHVs!! - by lzd
		- Fixed small python mistakes: on city name convertion, and on destroying barbarian improvements

		- The score no longer depend on date (to account for late starts and late UHV conditions) and huge points are rewarded for completing UHV conditions
		- Updated the reference folder with explanations about many UP and UHV

	Map and province changes:
		- New and/or improved city name map for most civs. Huge thanks to Michael Vick and Morholt for their help

		- Dawn of Man text for Byzantium
		- XML cleanup
		- Dawn of Man text fix for Venice

		- Art cleanup
		- Spy has "Monk-art" in the renaissance era instead of the secret agent art
		- Great Spy doesn't get the modern art in the Renaissance

		- Fixed Luxury Store button

	Balance:
		- Norse got an additional Berserker on spawn
		- Star Fort doesn't damages units in the area anymore, defense and bombard-free defense increased 25% (was 20%)
		- Swiss Line Infantry is later available
		- Large (>10 cities) unstable Empires no longer collapse instantly, they first start to rapidly lose cities
		- fixed a bug with collapse and respawning in a different region (safeMotherland in C++)
		- nerfed France and Burgundy (in Units production)
		- the French UP is disabled for the AI, it seems to do well enough with it anyway (AI doesn't build Charlemagne's Empire)

		- various balance tweaks, the AI is about as good as it will ever get
		- the Dutch UHV now requires 5 colonies (I got 7 in my game, but had no powerful enemies)

		- The Dutch properly start with Merchant Republic civic, as they were a Republic
		- Minor boost to English research and building construction rate, they were often unreasonably behind
		- Ottomans and Venice used to get stability bonuses, now those bonuses expire after 1581AD and 1204AD (Ottomans bonus for the Human is weak and Human Venice gets no bonus)

	Bugfixes:

		- the way secession used to work, one can have -30 stability and 20 cities in Stable provinces and not collapse, now some cities are guaranteed to split

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Beta 14 (Release Candidate):
(released: 2012.01.08.)

	General changes and UHV updates:
		- Add a stability guide in the civilopedia (Beware, the guide is outdated at some points)
		- Vinland is buildable until 1250 (but the UHV is unchanged), adds 1 Timber and 1 Wine for now
		- Lowered both Cordoban leaders chance for capitulation (now they should be extremely hard to capitulate)
		- Colony screen always shows all the civs
		- Adjusted "home flags" on the colony screen
		- Swedish Tennant is now a Night Watch replacement (what's the fun in a UB if it's preplaced in all your cities so you can never build it?) - from RFCE++
		- By the same logic, Aqueduct (Hammam) is no longer a preplaced building for the Ottomans. They have reduced cost though
		- Temple Mount (preplaced in Jerusalem) adds a Relic resource
		- Arabian UHV requires 35% islam instead of 25%
		- When the Jews are prosecuted from one city, then automatically move to another city from a player that is most tolerant (measured by civics and lack of prosecutions)
				This means that you will not be able to completely remove the Jews from the map (and leave only Jerusalem), but that at best you can get the Jews out of your land
				Also, there should be a lot more Jews left in late game
		- All UHVs, AI and mercenary regions, defensive crusades are updated to the new map and provinces
		- Many barbarian spawns got separated: they should be hard on the human player, but much easier if the civ is played by the AI
		- Removed Kharkov, Samara and Bulgar as indy cities. New indy spawns: Kursk in 800 AD, Nizhny Novgorod in 1320 AD. Smolensk now spawns earlier, in 960 AD
		- Cordoban and Kievan province stability updated
		- Added Shrine of Uppsala code: +1 culture for all your cities if you don't have a state religion
		- Added Pagan Shrine code so the Culture bonus goes with No State Religon only and the Shrine is now obsolete with Divine Right.
		- Shrine of Uppsala happiness bonus reduced (now that the new bonus is in place), but it gives 2 Great Prophet/Theologian points
		- Viking 2nd UHV now needs Northumbria not Mercia, so York covers it
		- Temples and the Shrine of Uppsala moved to the Religious Art tech, while the "build" culture option moved to the Literature tech
		- Increased first culture expansion (Fledging) to 20 culture. We may increase it a little more, will see for the next version
		- Added Palm Forest feature as light forest, mostly for aesthatics. No extra yields for the tile, stays when improved (so no chopping), 10% defence for units
		- Updates and fixes to some terrain, feature and improvement dependencies:
				All tiles which produce at least one food are settleable
				Now you can build cottages on flood plains, workshops on moorlands as it was intended.
				Cottages are only buildable where the base tile (sum of terrain and elevation) produces at least one food
				Increased chopping bonus from dense forest
				May have to set dummy chopping values for Palm Forest with a few improvements - it's possible that it doesn't look good with all of them
		- You can now Shift + Hover over the map and see the Spawn zones for each player. Just hover around the area where they will spawn.
		- Added Caliom's World Builder tool to the main version. Mostly for the modders, but also handy to check settler/war map or spawn/respawn area visualizations
		- New UHV for Kiev, now they have to hold 10 provinces out of 13 in their historically accurate region

	Mercenaries:
		- Mercs desert only if you don't have enough gold AND your Commerce slider is set to 0 (i.e. there is no way to get more money)
		- Mercs now show proper text if they leave the Merc pool and Mercs show the province where they become available (when they become available)
		- New Mercs: Doppelsoldner, Irish Brigade, Stradiot, Waardgelder, Naffatun, Turkopoles, Walloon Guard,
				Swiss Line Infantry, Lipka Tatars, Highlander Infantry, Zanji Spearman (Sudan Spearman),
				Touareg Camel Archer, Medjay (Nubian Longbowman)
		- Swiss Pikeman available in a much bigger area, Almogavar available in Greece (Catalan Company)
		- New art for Don Cossack, Huscarl
		- Mercs should get proper promotion prerequisites now, you should no longer see Mercs with Combat III but no Combat I and II

	Huge map overhaul:
		- Totally new Iberia, North Africa, Britain, Atlantic Islands, Scandinavia
		- Major changes to France, the Austrian/Venetian/Dalmatian area, southern Bulgaria, Finland
		- Minor changes to the Mediterranean Islands, Lombardy and Tuscany, southern Hungary
		- More realistic rivers and revised resource placement in most of the mentioned areas
		- New provinces: Fez, Navarre, La Mancha, Gotland
		- Moved capital/starting location: Cordoba, Leon, Lisboa, London, Frankfurt, Wien, Preslav, Stockholm, Moscow
		- Revised all indy/barb cities spawn coordinates and spawn attributes
		- Adjusted core and normal areas to fit the recent changes
		- Updated all civs' war and settler maps
		- Added palm/light forest to the mediterranean coast

	Other map and province changes:
		- Coffee isn't preplaced, but appears around 1450 AD
		- Removed Relic resource from the map (was under Jerusalem)
		- Indy Porto renamed to Portucale
		- Moved Estonia to Estern Europe Region, otherwise Barbarians from Estonia were trying to attack the Norse in Scandinavia and they had no way to get there
		- Same as Estonia, Morocco had to be moved from the Islands Region to the North Africa Region
		- Moved Bosnia and Croatia to Central Europe Region, hopefully this will help the Venice AI
		- Norrland province is only in Sweden, Osterland expanded
		- Expanded North African provinces - needed for barbarian spawn areas (so AI regions don't mess them up if they are outside their region)

	XML/text updates:
		- XML Cleanup in the audio files and in the dynamic civ names
		- More Unique Dawn of Man texts
		- Various fixes in the GP names - now all of them should work fine
		- Swedish Soldier Tennant renamed to Soldattorp
		- Pedia entry for Luxury Store, Apothecary, Zaporozhian Cossack, Don Cossack, Hackapell

		- Dynamic civ names for Lithuania
		- Added a couple more unique names to barbarians
		- Improved DCN for Arabia, France and Norse
		- Link to the Mercenary-Concepts for Mercenary units
		- Changed the Prophet to Theologian

	Art/Sound updates:
		- New icons for the civilopedia categories
		- Religious building sounds updated. Now all of them have build sounds (including Pagan Shrine and Jewish buildings)
		- Merged buttons into several atlas' (this should reduce the loading time of the mod a bit)
		- New art for the Tercio
		- New Art + Button for Kazimierz
		- New cultural citystyles for all civs. Now we have 8 different styles for the different ethnic regions 

	Balance:
		- Improved french start (+1 axeman and +1 worker)
		- Reduced early barbarian Sassanid pressure on Byzantium, and early christian barb pressure on Cordoba (only on Emperor difficulty)
		- Increased NE barbarian pressure on Bulgaria, also more Pecheneg and Cuman activity in and near the Carpathian-basin
		- Seljuks strike on Anatolia harder, but lighter in the Levant. OTOH increased Beduin barbarian threat from the Arabian peninsula
		- Barbarian culture is enabled again, it was really hurting the Barbs by making them build useless Culture in their cities, it was removed only as a speedup feature in the first place anyway
		- Merc Upkeep cost also depends on the hammer cost of the Unit
		- Brewery replaced by Tavern with +1 happy from wine and barley, also small +5% gold bonus
		- Inn has +5% gold bonus independent from wine (Note: Inn should be renamed to something to represent the Secret Societies like Masons and Assasins)
		- Indy Porto strengthened - it shouldn't be conquered by Leon before the Portuguese spawn
		- Decreased all Muscovian leaders willingness to vassalization

	Bugfixes:
		- Fixed a bug where Abo did not spawn (so Sweden didn't get a city in Finland)
		- Updated special respawns in the RiseAndFall.py, now they work properly
		- Bugfix in the Bulgarian 3rd UHV (could switch back to failed, even after you successfully completed it)
		- Fixed a bug in the new Janissary UP and Prosecutions, as per Morhlot suggestion, the game will no longer crash at that point
		- Fixed an inconsistency in the Merc screen, now all Mercs have the format Unity Type (Merc Name), Axeman (Serbian)
		- Fixed a bug in stability calculation on city razing
		- Fixed a bug with the dates for founding religions, now things properly save/load
		- Fixed a founding bug allowing non-Catholics to found Protestantism

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Beta 13:
(released: 2011.10.16.)

	Major Changes:
		- New Mercenary scheme:
			- You cannot contract your units out (basically sell) as mercenaries anymore, mercs are only there to hire them
			- Mercs are tied to provinces, thus we can have region specific mercs. Also they appear in the given province when hired
			- Mercenaries are also tied to specific intervals on the timeline
			- Added a bunch of generic mercs, they can be updated with specific names later on
			- Added the following unique mercenaries: Condottiero, Swiss Pikeman, Almogavar, Black Guard, Varangian Guard, Huscarl, Hackapell, Reiter, Zaporozhian Cossack, Don Cossack (more to come in later versions)
			- Readded Tagmata, Corsair, Welsh Longbowman, Highlander as unique mercenaries (some of these also availeable as barbs)
			- Update to Merc Mechanics: Mercs are only available at one province at a time
			- Mercs can also randomly leave the pool
			- You can only hire a merc in a province where you have at least one city with 10 culture points (culture level more than poor)
			- The player gets a message when new Mercs become available
			- If a player doesn't have enough gold to support the currently hired mercs, then some of the mercs will desert
		- Revised crusade mechanics:
			- Some of the crusader units will leave after capturing Jerusalem
			- Templars and Teutonic Knights never return, and they can be hired as mercenaries in the region, especially around Jerusalem
			- Added Jerusalem Minor Nation so that it will revolt against the Crusaders and make it hard to keep Jerusalem
			- Syria also got minor nation status, so Damascus won't be a so tempting target. The goal is to make Jerusalem the most important city in the region for the player too
			- Jerusalem is on a relic bonus (so the contoller of the city gets a relic resource)
		- Golden Age now allows for Anarchy-free change of Civics and Religion (like in regular BtS)
		- Interface:
			- New screen to display which colonies have been built.
			- The Main Screen shows the percent penalty for researching techs early or late
			- New starting theme (intro screen) is a scrolling image of the Bayeaux Tapestry
			- Since the Bayeaux Tapestry doesn't work properly yet, we replaced it with a static image of The Siege of Acre, at least for now
			- Adjusted Dawn of Man screen
			- Merc names and Barbarian names appear in the format: Horse Archer (Khazars)
		- Graphics light version:
			- In the RFCEurope\Assets\XML\Civilizations and RFCEurope\Assets\XML\Art folders, there are two files that end with .xml_light
			- If those two files replace the corresponding .xml files, then the game will use only BtS leaderhead graphics and the mod will be much lighter

		- Added all missing UHV names (a couple Sweden, Genoan and Lithuanian)

	Python/C++ updates and AI tweaks:

		- Cleaned some old Rhye code from the Victory and RFCEvent modules
		- Removed some debug messages generated by Plagues
		- Some balance tweaks for the new AI behavior (spliting Europe into areas made a significant impact on the AI)
		- The AI now considers WarMaps when picking a city to attack (before WarMaps were only used for scripted wars)
		- SettlerMaps no longer used in the city attack algorithm

		- Austrian Kuirassier doesn't ignore building defences

		- Removed second settler and a few initial units from the Portugal spawn (as Porto flips to them)
		- Upkeep for Militarism and Imperialism is now Medium and High respectively
		- Adjusted the Mongols so that they will hit Hungary more often and also added another invasion spot near Bulgaria
		- Increased the power of Venice AI (in the special modifiers)
		- Venice (city) gets a pre-build City Walls since the rivers don't provide enough defense
		- Ragusa was keeping Venice down, now Venice AI is constantly at war with Ragusa and the plot of Ragusa was changed to flat-land (no defensive bonus)

		- Fixed a mongol spawn bug in Barbs.py (only appeared on Viceroy)
		- Fixed a bug associated with the return of the crusades, the game crashes if the unit conquering Jerusalem has to return, now Crusaders return on the next turn after the fall of Jerusalem

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Fixed Casimir's icon not showing
	Crusaders no longer spawn if Jerusalem changes ownership to Catholic or Orthodox on the way

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(released: 2009.06.18.)

	Fixed the bug of everyone having contact with the Pope from the very beginning

	Fixed the timing for the Kiev's UHV

	Kiev spelling changes as suggested   
	Added the Great Schism: Orthodox and Catholic players treat each other as "brothers in faith" until 1054AD   
	Fixed the independent constant war bug, now all independents go to peace after some time   
	Fixed a AI vs Independents war bug, used to be the AI wouldn't go to war against some independents   
	Now Crusaders get siege Weapons as well (Jerusalem cannot fall otherwise)   
	The first Catholic nation that captures Jerusalem gets the 8 tiles adjacent to it, i.e. establishes a small Crusader state and is not immediately devoured by the Arabic culture   
	Try to make Crusader spawn not across the river from Jerusalem (less defensive bonuses for the city)   
	Religion cannot be purged out of its holy city   
	Religious prosecutions are not possible in Jerusalem   
	Jerusalem and the various Holy Cities cannot be razed   
	Fixed a bug making the AI agree on Defensive Pacts very easily   
	Defensive Pacts between players of different religions is much less likely   
	Defensive Pact trading now enables with Military Tradition (as opposed to Chivalry)   
	Independent culture in cities dissolves with time, no more "... join motherland ..." 200 turns after you have conquered an indy city   
	Fixed a bug that made sometimes Mongols in the middle of marshes (where they can get nowhere and no one can get to them)   
	Bulgar/Kazan and Samara are no longer in the Moscowan spawn areas (Moscow now flip 4 as opposed to 6 cities)   
	The Moscow UP now covers maintenance for the civics as well the cities themselves

	All colonies now require Atlantic Access (except for the two trading companies)   
	All colonies but two require one TC or another (as per Jessiecat's idea)   
	Atlantic Access locations have now changed. Only traditional colonial powers get AA, others have to trade or fight for control of Gibraltar or some other strategic location   
	Minor map update on the Balkans (the Balkan mountain can now be crossed on several locations)   
	The Pope can now build unlimited Missionaries and Prosecutors   
	Tweaked the Pope's AI to go for the construction of more Missionaries and Prosecutors   
	The Pope now sends his Prosecutors to other catholic nations and gifts them (needs to be tested)   
	Updated the AI personalities of all leaders to better match their UHVs and situations   
	Techs in the Tech tree have better tags for the AI (i.e. the benefits are correctly recognized as military vs gold vs culture)   
	Updated visible areas upon spawn (not everything discussed is in, but being able to see land very far away will have no effect on the gameplay)   
	Updated contacts on spawn (Byzantines now know the Pope, Kiev doesn't have to wait to meet Bulgaria and Byzantium and so on)   
	New Leaderhead graphics for: Burgundy, Bulgaria, Norse, Kiev, Poland, Swedan and the Pope (still need Hungary, Cordoba, Genoa and Austria)   
	Updated city name map from micbic   
	Included the Russian Addon (I hope properly). There are only a few tags missing (3 + 1 that needs clarification), I have neither the Russian skill nor the tools to translate anything into the numerical values for Cyrillic, sorry!   
	If you select to load the mod from the regular Civ Menu, you should immediately be taken to the Civ selection screen   
	Iberian WB map update as Michael Vick requested, I hope I got it right   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Starting year, loading time and UHV/UP information now fully exported to XML, should be easier to update   
	Updated the Spanish starting year info   
	Also the five star ratings are exported to XML, someone should come up with accurate ratings for each Civ   
	Map update on the Balkan terrain around Sofia to better represent the highest Balkan mountains and hopefully make the AI settle there (it was a large city even at that time)   
	The Pope starts with Catholicism as State Religion   
	The Byzantines start with Orthodoxy (their stability is bad without the extra anarchy)   
	Projects generate points just like World Wonders   
	The first Catholic player who manages to obtain control over Jerusalem will enter a golden age   
	Civs start with their natural area of expansion visible (should help the AI settle better)

	Fixed bug with barb spawning at Emperor level
	Fixed stability bug where dead civs weren't counted correctly for open borders and wars.

	New spawn area includes more of Normandy
	Calais spawns later (to avoid being killed by barb-vikings)
	New English UHVs

	New Cordoban UHVs
	New indies to represent the early Christian kingdoms
	Later/more powerful Spain
	A crude boost to the AI weighting of projects now has the AI building some colonies.

Changes for Test Version 2009.03.22.:

		Better version of Moscow and Bulgaria flag, symbol still a bit too complicated to work well IMHO
		New Hungarian flag
		Worst tech button art fixed.
		Slightly better Russian Kremlin art.
	
	Misc:
		Dense Forest now allows mines, watermills, and camps from the start (as these do not clear the dense forest). Lumbermills allowed with appropriate tech.
		Other improvements are only available after the clearing of the dense forest. You need to research Machine Tools for that (tech tree displays this funny though)
		New city name maps from micbic
		New wonders from JediClemente
		Krak des Chevaliers now works
		Restored Serfdom village growth penalty
		House of Wisdom gives +100% science (obsolete at Education). This is offset by the penalty on Arabic/Cordoban science.

		Fixed bug with many early civs getting Education at start.
		Fixed some starting techs to be in sync with progression of maritime techs.
		Rice removed from WorldBuilderSave, now spawns on the map at appropriate time (see Resources.py)
		In Iberia, the goal is that the Spanish/Portuguese AI normally takes over the peninsula. I think we will have to adjust UHVs around this fact.
		Cordoban AI now expands more into Portugal, to increase this fight
		Barbarians spawn in North Africa to provide another challenge for Cordoba around 1000 AD.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.03.14.:

	Overhauled buildings. Main features:
		More religious buildings and religious buildings are important for early science (library -> scriptorium). Catholicism and Orthodoxy are equivalent, but Protestantism and Islam have somewhat different buildings. Some new art to accompany these changes, but not finished (particularly Orthodoxy).
		Removed colosseum and re-assigned or gave new UBs to the civs affected
		Resources now are more even. Each health/happy resource now has one building which produces a better product from the raw material (causes it to give +1 more happy/health) and one which sells the resource (causes it to give +% food or money).
		Some production buildings (Forge/Mason/Carpenter) now give production bonuses only with the appropriate resources. 
		Market is now prerequisite for some of the buildings which sell something.
		New Arabic UB, Bazaar replacing Market (Madrassa is now a generic Islamic building)
	
	Map changes:
		Map changes from Jessiecat
		Modified city names from micbic
		Spanish WarMap redone to encourage killing Corodoba
		Arab WarMap redone to encourage invading Turkey

		Scientist renamed scholar
		Bulgarian UHV can no longer be to build libraries. Currently set to Scriptoria in the code, but not in the description.

		Dense Forest no longer allows farms, mines, etc. Only lumber-mills can be built here (eventually).
		Barbarians around Bulgaria a bit weaker
		Made Cordoba even weaker, and Spain hate them more.
		Turkey starts with a couple Islamic Missionaries.
		Trading Companies no longer count as a colony for victory.
		Guisarme made cheaper 60 -> 50
		Heavy Lancer made weaker 11 -> 10 to address imbalance
		African colonies (except South Africa) moved earlier and no longer require Trading Companies
		Road movement increases to 3 with Vaulted Arches
		Modified some spawn units a little.
		Gave later spawning civs some health buildings so they don't start unhealthy.
		Resurrecting civs get better units now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Misc:
		Made .xml file for Great Person name list so that these should show up correctly now
		Introduced some more Corporation Competition
		Pushed Corporations a bit back in time
		Fiddled with Colors/flags many civs. Flag symbols still need work. Still need many new buttons. Colors are approaching final colors.
		Replaced Bank-spread exec with new model
		Change Kievan Leader Name to Yaroslav the Wise
		Fixed Hudson Bay Colony Art
		Introduced East/West India Art
		Updated Art for Moscow UB (Currently medieval walls with towers, Civilopedia entry still looks like normal walls...)
	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.27.:

	New Features:
		More work on corporations. Some executive art included, though "spreading" animation is lacking. Less-bad corporate HQ building art. All special knights now included, and new Portuguese UU included. 
		Limited version of Judaism added, though this may introduce some oddities in religion spreading for now. Currently this religion does nothing.
		Added new period/area-appropriate GP names compiled by Jessiecat

	Misc:
		French UB, Salon, moved to Scientific Method just like Observatory
		Konnik brought into line with new Horse Archer (both with cost and First Strikes)
		Adjusted Ghazi/Berber costs
		Adjusted Beserker cost
		Theodosian Walls now pre-built in Constantinople to make it harder to take initially
		Cordoba is weaker, Spain stronger, in attempt to get better Iberian dynamic
		Burgundy and France are friendlier initially (though they still tend to go to war too often)
		Unit costs raised by 50% across the board
		Fixed bug with English UP (just an offset in Consts.py) so now they don't have super mines anymore
		Changed Polish color/flag, mostly just to check that I could
		Other civ colors changed, though much work remains to sync colors with potential flags

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.22.:

	Corporations added, though still not complete.
		See wiki (http://wikirhye.wikidot.com/rfce-corporations) for plans.
		Specifically -- the military orders are still missing their special units/buildings
		Portugal no longer has a UU, and the executives and HQ buildings art is not yet changed. 
		Added some corporation art

	Bugfix:
		Bug-fix preventing Protestantism from spreading
		Bug-fix in getColonies (line 714 of Victory.py) possibly blocking Portugal UHV
		Bug-fix in changeColonies (line 262 of Victory.py)
		Bug-fix which was blocking cottage growth. Cottages still incorrectly report time to grow.

	Balance:
		Trading companies come earlier (they had been re-positioned on the tree, but their prereqs are now relaxed)
		Turkish spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Swedish spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Dutch spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Later tech costs (Late Middle Ages and later) costs increased in XML by ~150%. This should help slow tech rate, though probably not enough yet.
		Serfdom drops slow cottage growth and gains Medium upkeep.
		
	Misc:
		Added colony art splash screens (i.e. on build) from jessiecat.
		Added new resource: Relic, available from Teutonic Knights and (planned) from certain Wonders
		Judaism is back as a stump religion. It should stay confined to Jerusalem for now. Proper implementation will come soon.
		Latest city name map from micbic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.17.:

	Protestantism:
		Added modified protestantism code from Panoptican's Protestantism for RFC, see that mod for full details.
		Protestantism is founded if you are Catholic State Religion and first to research (or acquire) Printing Press.
		When this happens every nation has choice to flip (converting Catholic buildings and cities) or not. AI goes randomly (based partly on history), human chooses.
		Some Catholics may linger if you flip and some Protestants may spawn even if you refuse to flip. 

	Units:
		Restored Pinch Promotion
		Removed Longbow city defense bonus
		Mounted Infantry now upgrade to foot-knights (remove city-raider knights)
		Horse Archer made weaker (strength 5)
		Spearmen and Guisarme bonus vs. heavy cavalry raised from 50% to 75%

	Resources:
		Added "Atlantic Access" to strategic places on map. Revealed with Astronomy.
		AAs sort of crudely represent important ports on the Atlantic and are distributed to encourage the historic colonizers (England, Spain, Portugal, France, Dutch) to build colonies.
		Atlantic Access has some artwork now

	Misc:
		New intro screen from Jessiecat
		Latest city name maps from Micbic
		Arabic technologies associated with earlier era.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.03.:

	New Art:
		New Colony Icons
		Introduced eras. New era splash screens and names. Let me know of any artwork/sounds oddities due to this.

	Misc:
		Tweaked colony resources and added Virginia and East Africa
		Removed 1st early annoying plague
		Gave Portugal better starting units
		Mercs now spawn at your capitol
		AI shouldn't bug you to switch to Paganism anymore
		Include updated Frankia UHV map
		Re-arranged building order a little to be consistent.
		England now starts with a couple Lancers and without warriors
		England now gains armored lancers if anyone declares war on-spawn
		Barb warriors in Wales and barb axe/spear spawn in Scotland so unification is harder.
