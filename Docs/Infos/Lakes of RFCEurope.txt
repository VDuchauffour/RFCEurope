Note that in RFCE lakes are part of provinces, they are not handled as separate provinces/regions as in SoI.
Collected them together here, this is what I have currently:

Lough Neagh, Ireland, 392 km2 - 1 tile
Lake Balaton, Hungary, 592 km2 - 2 tiles, should be 1, but represented this way because of it's shape
Dead Sea, Levant, 600 km2 - while it's too small for 2 tiles, represented that way because of the Sea of Galilee
Sea of Galilee, Levant, 167 km2 - too small, but still represented because it's significant role in the Levant and around the Crusades
