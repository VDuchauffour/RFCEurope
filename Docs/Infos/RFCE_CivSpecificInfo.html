<a name="iByzantium">
<h2>Byzantine Empire</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>So long as the Byzantines have control over Constantinople, they cannot collapse and cities within their core area will not rebel. On the other hand, if they lose Constantinople, they suffer from a bigger stability hit than other civs.</p>



<a name="iFrankia">
<h2>Frank Empire/France</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>France gets a boost for each city in OK and Unstable provinces, much like the Imperialism civic. The boost is capped at 6 points.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The hardest UHV condition is to get the cities early on. There are several viable strategies, but the timing should be well executed. Mounted Sergeants can help a lot and a good time to attack the Independents (especially in Italy) is right after the plague.</p>
<p>To complete the Crusader UHV you should be careful about the rebellions in Jerusalem. One viable strategy is to keep taking control over the Crusades, but conquer the rest of the area first before getting Jerusalem itself.</p>



<a name="iArabia">
<h2>Arabia</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Whenever you acquire a new city (either by conquest, trade or flip), your state religion will automatically spread to it along with a free Temple. This is very useful to achieve the UHV.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The hardest UHV condition is to spread Islam. You can do it in several different ways: build huge cities with the Islamic faith power, conquer Byzantium early on, or wait for the Ottomans to do most of the spreading and conquering (just make sure to keep them friendly).</p>



<a name="iBulgaria">
<h2>Bulgaria</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Newly conquered cities do not resist, but get right to work.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Sometimes you can get lucky to capture Constantinople early on, this happens if the Plague kills all the defenders. If not, then make sure to capture Odrin (Adrianople) and Solun (Thessaloniki) as soon as possible, then focus on Konniks and make sure to bring lots of Catapults.</p>
<p>The second UHV relies on using Constantinople to get plenty of Theologians and use them to build up Faith Points.</p>
<p>For the Ottoman UHV, you have to refuse the flip of Odrin. If you allow the city to flip, you will lose the UHV. Remember that if you refuse the flip, then some of your units will defect, so plan ahead with a large army.</p>



<a name="iCordoba">
<h2>Cordoba</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All units start with Medic I promotion.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>To win the first UHV, you have to settle a city (Cordoba) right on the spot where you spawn. You will most likely compete with Constantinople or Alexandria for the biggest city title.</p>
<p>For the last UHV, you don't have to kill Spain or Portugal, just make sure that you have Open Borders and spread Islam with missionaries. However, Spain can persecute non-Catholic religions rather aggressively, so conquest is a perfectly reasonable option.</p>



<a name="iNorse">
<h2>The Norse/The Vikings</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All naval units can enter and move through Ocean tiles.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Being able to move across Ocean tiles even with your early ships means that you are the only one who can settle Iceland early on. As trade over Ocean tiles is also enabled early for the Norse, you can build the Vinland project back in Denmark (if you settle Iceland, you will get the North America access in all of your cities).</p>
<p>Use the UP to hide ships in safe territory and heal Berserkers, then launch fast attacks to coastal cities. Make sure you send troops to Sicily early enough, and remember that ships move twice as fast across Ocean tiles.</p>



<a name="iVenecia">
<h2>Venice</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Venetians start with the Merchant Republic civic on turn 1, much sooner than other players can use it.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The easiest way to conquer Constantinople is get enough gold to steal a Crusade. Direct assault is also an option, but you will be fighting a larger and more powerful Empire. Another option is to combine forces with Bulgaria.</p>
<p>For the last UHV, you need the resource Atlantic Access. Probably the best place to get one is right at the Gibraltar straight, but you will have to fight Spain, Portugal or Cordoba for control over it.</p>



<a name="iBurgundy">
<h2>Burgundy</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>+2 Culture and +1 Happiness in every city.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The culture points are accumulated every turn, it's the sum of the culture production in all your cities. Great Artist's culture bombs don't count, but they add culture for the UHV if you settle them in your cities.</p>



<a name="iGermany">
<h2>Germany/Holy Roman Empire/Prussia</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>After the discovery of Gunpowder, all units cost 25% less hammers to build.</p>



<a name="iKiev">
<h2>Kievan Rus</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>The central tile of every city produces 4 food instead of 2.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge is the defense against the Mongols. Note that the Keshiks are Light Cavalry and hence the Formation promotion will not help. Use Drujinas with two combat promotions and Knights. Polearm units can defend your cities, but if you let the Mongols pillage all your farms, you will have hard time with the food related UHV.</p>
<p>The third UHV forces you to get as many cities as you can, and as early as possible. The longer you hold a city, the more food it contributes to the UHV, as all the food you produce is added to the total food amount, on each turn.</p>
<p>The second and third UHV requires you to spread out, but the first one requires you to focus on other things too, not only expanding and military. Religion and religious culture was also very imporant in the Kievan Rus. Plan well and balance your attention and resources.</p>



<a name="iHungary">
<h2>Hungary</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>You do not suffer stability penalty from foreign culture in your cities (no -1 stability if your culture is less than 40%), or happiness penalty (so there is no "we want to join our motherland" unhappiness in your cities). You also get +1 happiness.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get Free Religion is to build the Golden Bull, which provides you access to all Religious Civics. You can get the wonder fairly early on.</p>
<p>The Ottomans can be tricky, you must push them out of the Balkans. Bulgaria will always lose Odrin (Adrianople) and the Byzantines cannot hold Constantinople on their own. It's probably wise to maintain a friendship with Bulgaria and Byzantium to have an ally in the area, and aggressively attack the Ottomans before they get way too powerful.</p>



<a name="iSpain">
<h2>Spain</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>+2 espionage points per city and you can persecute non-state religions without stability penalty.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Kill Cordoba fast, if they build any Islamic wonder in Iberia you will have a much harder time persecuting the city. Take advantage of the defensive Crusades. Also, beware of Portugal starting the Reformation. If the Protestant Holy City is in Iberia that means you failed the UHV, as you can neither persecute nor raze it.</p>
<p>For the last UHV you will have to grow in strength as much as possible and be aggressive towards other religions. By this time, Protestants (France, Germany and England) and Muslims (Ottomans) would be the biggest threat. Use the Victory screen to pick a target.</p>



<a name="iPoland">
<h2>Poland</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Foreign religion will cause neither unhappiness nor instability.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>You must be on top of the Agriculture chart for at least one turn between 1500 and 1520 AD.</p>



<a name="iGenoa">
<h2>Genoa</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Both the hiring and the upkeep cost are halved for Mercenaries.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Exports and Imports are calculated by counting the amount of commerce produced by trade routes with other nations. To maximize trade, have Open Borders with as many nations as possible, especially if they are far away. Get all buildings and civics that boost the number of trade routes and the commerce generated by trade routes. As sea trade routes generate extra commerce, island cities will usually contribute more than landlocked cities.</p>



<a name="iEngland">
<h2>England</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Workshops give +2 hammers, this effectively makes a grassland tile with workshop equal to a mine.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Conquering France can be hard. One strategy is to take some time, build up a large army and then make a quick strike at Paris. If you get the city, with some luck France will collapse pretty soon, leaving only independent cities to be conquered.</p>
<p>Protestantism is a great choice for your late game religion, as it gives you a boost both for colonies and for research.</p>


<a name="iPortugal">
<h2>Portugal</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All colonial projects and Trading Companies are 40% cheaper.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Be careful where you expand. You may conquer some cities early on, even capture Cordoba. However, keep in mind that if you get in the Spanish expansional plans in the Iberian peninsula, they will probably attack you next after Cordoba is gone.</p>



<a name="iLithuania">
<h2>Lithuania</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>+2 Culture and +1 Happiness in every city as long as you don't have a state religion.</p>



<a name="iAustria">
<h2>Austria/Habsburg Dynasty</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Austria gets a hidden diplomatic modifier with all AI civilizations, so it's much easier to maintain good relations with the other civs. Also, Austria gets +2 points culture boost per city so they don't get overwhelmed by the culture of Germany and Hungary (older civs can produce huge amounts of culture).</p>




<a name="iTurkey">
<h2>Ottoman Empire</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>For every Ottoman city with a religion other than the state religion, the Ottomans gain Janissary points equal to the size of the city (for each non-state religion). Every 400 points, the Ottomans get a free Janissary unit in a random city.</p>



<a name="iMoscow">
<h2>Moscow/Russia</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All city related maintenance costs are halved (civic, number of cities, city distance), thus the Muscovian economy can handle a lot more cities with the same cost.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Depending on the Balkan situation, you may be able to ally with fellow Orthodox nations (Byzantines and/or Bulgarians) to fight either the Ottomans or the Crusaders (Venice or Genoa). If the Ottoman Empire is too strong and you cannot conquer Constantinople, then you should go against Lithuania and fight Sweden for control of the Baltic Sea. An Atlantic Access resource spawns near Sweden in 1680AD.</p>



<a name="iSweden">
<h2>Sweden</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All units start with Formation promotion.</p>



<a name="iDutch">
<h2>The Netherlands</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Every Dutch city has two additional trade routes.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Depending on the starting situation, the Dutch can be very hard to play with. As a small country, it will be hard to hold off potential attacks from France, Germany and England. Keep your cities well defended and don't hesitate to pay gold for peace.</p>
<p>Amsterdam Beurs can be a huge help (a huge boost to your economy) if you are able to grab the wonder before other civs.</p>
<p>You can use your second initial settler to found a city in one of the Atlantic islands. The territory you can control in mainland Europe is very limited.</p>
