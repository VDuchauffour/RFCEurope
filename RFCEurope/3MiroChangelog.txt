This file is for me to keep track of things. I may merge it with README later:

Done: for BETA 6
- merijn_v1 updates some text on the new Manor House/Civic
- art and text changes by merijn_v1
- fixed Hungarian spawn units (2 Axes, 3 Horse Archers)
- fixed Hungarian UU, now it accurately replaces the Heavy Lancer
- removed the Congress.py file, it wasn't used at all
- removed the first strikes from the Konnik
- moved the Heavy Lancer Icon to Blast Furnace

- Increaded the FP bonus form Cathedrals to 3
- Increased the requirement for Bulgarian UHV to 60 points
- Faith points are capped at 60, can be adjusted for every individual religion
- Pope AI now avoids the Printing Press
- Added AI cheat code, now some players get bonus for AI to AI battles. We can use that to boost some Ai players and get more historic game (like Ottomans vs Byzantium and Bulgaria)
- Dutch gets a "hidden" buff on the Faith Points, with only couple of cities, they can never accumulate enough
- lots of leaderhead and XML text changes from AbsintheRed
- merijn_v1 updates pedia (and Barb leader no longer shows)
- merijn_v1 updates art for Burgundian Winery
- Free Religion now allows construction of Cathedrals and Wonders from all religions

- Bugfix - Manor House used to not give Stability
- Bugfix - Spanish UP now gives Espionage points
- Bugfix - Genoa Bank and Corp UHV
- Bugfix - Human now gets only +1 Faith from prosecuting (the AI gets +1, Human used to get +2)
- Bugfix - Norse get Manorialism as a starting tech
- Bugfix - French leaders now follow correctly Charlemagne, Joan, Jouis
- Bugfix - Updated the starting years on the autorun Popup screen (Bulgaria, Hungary, Kiev and Cordoba were off)

Done: for BETA 5
- added merijn_v1 XML modifications, some unit abilities and removing old and unused XML entries
- Fixed the Papal Culture Bug
- Fixed Venetian UHV
- Moved Hungarian and Kievan starting turns, with no conflict with Cordoba, we can use more historical dates (note on the bug of one extra autoturn)
- Added info for Stability, Faith, GP and GG
- Removed the exile mechanics
- Nerf to the Barbarians around Frankia, to many to allow you to grow
- Changed the Bulgarian Konnik to more appropriate early Lancer, Bulgaria now gets fewer Konniks on spawn (looks balanced)
- Cordoba and Turkey now start Muslim, the Dutch start Protestant
- Moved the Autorun constants to Python (now we don't have to worry about strange bugs like fighting barbs or meeting other nations before you spawn, if we change the unit XML files, just keep Python in sync)
- Updated small region on the map in the middle of the desert, has to do with the Autorun so "don't touch"
- Get a speedup the hack on the semi-random bugfix from Beta 4 (look below)
- Move University to Philosophy, Education gives a free GS
- National University goes to Paper
- Brewery: +1 Happy, Happyness with berley, (removed one person scientist, I didn't realize we had that with the Monasteries), lowered cost
- Change the Smokeshouse to give health from meat, changed the cost of building it
- Guild hall gives an engineer, an engeneer slot and a merchant slot
- Removed Stability bonus from the Dungeon
- Cordoba, Turkey and the Dutch start with their religions already set
- Updated main menu music (much better quality)
- Market gives only one Merchant slot
- Inn gives +2 esp, 10% gold with wine, -10 war worry and 1 spy slot
- Many wonders now require a specific state religion (as opposed to a religion being in the city)
- Changed the Manor House to give money early on
- Manor house gives +2 gold only with Manorialism (the AI is "aware" of that)
- Early Lancers and Heavy Lancers are somewhat OP, rased the cost of tech and construction
- Mounted Sergeants and Horse Archers come with Stirrup
- Lancers reuire Farriers, Heavy Lancers require Blast Furnace
- The cost of early mounted units has increased
- Hungarian Huszars are not lighter version of Heavy Cavalry, they don't require Iron, they are a bit cheaper, strength reduced to 9 (very few units have bonus vs light-cavalry)
- Hungary starts with 3 Horse Archers (in place of a Swordsman and an Axeman)
- Ghazi are the same as before (didn't want to mess up Arabia)
- Druzjina and Cataphrac also require Blast Furnace and have their cost increased
- The strength of Pistoler increased to 12
- Chateau moved as Frankia's UB, Salon moved to Burgundy (we probably need something completely different for Burgundy, I think Brewery -> Winery for Burgundian wine)
- Chateau bonus changed to +2 hammers (Frankia can really use the boost early on)
- Brothers in Faith bonus (i.e. Round Church) gives you penalty to diplomacy with people form the same faith (keep Orthodox fighting each other, as they were historically)
- Civs without state religion (i.e. Pagans) suffee diplomatic penalty from players with State Religion
- Turkey should finally be getting Constantinople
- Changed the AI flags for the Mediterranean pirates to act more like the Vikings

Done: for BETA 4
- Synced Units (fixed Polish Pladin bug), Projects (fixed Portugal UP bug)
- Fixed Reformation bug, now checking for the correct buildings (CatholicScriptorium is no more)
- Changed Bulgarian UHV to conquer Constantinople by 1000AD (it is doable and more challenging then 1200AD)
- Changed Norce UHV to not count Independent cities
- Reduced the Cuman barbarians near Hungary, two lancers can easily take a city guarded even by two archers
- Add protestant missionary to the Dutch start (guarantess they are Protestant and helps them with the Faith Points)
- Redone identation of the UHV code, Python is very sensitive towards identations, should probably do it again
- Completely negate the Theodosian Walls after the discovery of Gunpowder (by anyone), Turkey still doesn't take Constantinople
- Fixed a very nasty semi-random bug cousing the old civs to kick a new civ out of the new civs' core area. The fix may cause the entire thing to run much slower, please report.
- English AI is too incompetent to capture Dublin, not the AI (and AI only) can cheat to do that (unless this conflicts with a major player)
- Crusader bug allowing you to avoid a Crusade if you put units surrounding Jerusalem (can no longer do that)

TODO:
- Rebalance Turkey, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland
- make Religions hate each other even more
- Rebalance tech speed and starting techs
- Autorun gets one extra turn sometimes
- Expose the Civ names code to Python
- Get the Round Church to give couple of mounted Units
- No unhappyness from non-state religion doesn't work with Religious Law Civic
- Check resources around Venice
- Maybe nerf the Manor House
- Early Culture?
- Great Generals leaving for the Crusade?
- Fix Bad Byzantine stability early on
- Fix Ottoman bad stability with expansion
- Norse UHV bug?
- Change the French and Burgundian UHV
- Check Genoa 1st Turn culture bug
