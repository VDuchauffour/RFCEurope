This file is for me to keep track of things. I may merge it with README later:

Done: for BETA 5
- added merijn_v1 XML modifications, some unit abilities and removing old and unused XML entries
- Fixed the Papal Culture Bug
- Fixed Venetian UHV
- Moved Hungarian and Kievan starting turns, with no conflict with Cordoba, we can use more historical dates (note on the bug of one extra autoturn)
- Added info for Stability, Faith, GP and GG
- Removed the exile mechanics
- Nerf to the Barbarians around Frankia, they were ridiculously many
- Changed the Bulgarian Konnik to more appropriate early Lancer, Bulgaria now gets fewer Konniks on spawn (looks balanced)
- Cordoba and Turkey now start Muslim, the Dutch start Protestant
- Moved the Autorun constants to Python (now we don't have to worry about strange bugs if we change the unit XML files, just keep Python in sync)
- Updated small region on the map in the middle of the desert, has to do with the Autorun so "don't touch"
- Get a speedup the hack on the semi-random bugfix from Beta 4 (look below)

Done: for BETA 4
- Synced Units (fixed Polish Pladin bug), Projects (fixed Portugal UP bug)
- Fixed Reformation bug, now checking for the correct buildings (CatholicScriptorium is no more)
- Changed Bulgarian UHV to conquer Constantinople by 1000AD (it is doable and more challenging then 1200AD)
- Changed Norce UHV to not count Independent cities
- Reduced the Cuman barbarians near Hungary, two lancers can easily take a city guarded even by two archers
- Add protestant missionary to the Dutch start (guarantess they are Protestant and helps them with the Faith Points)
- Redone identation of the UHV code, Python is very sensitive towards identations, should probably do it again
- Completely negate the Theodosian Walls after the discovery of Gunpowder (by anyone), Turkey still doesn't take Constantinople
- Fixed a very nasty semi-random bug cousing the old civs to kick a new civ out of the new civs' core area. The fix may cause the entire thing to run much slower, please report.
- English AI is too incompetent to capture Dublin, not the AI (and AI only) can cheat to do that (unless this conflicts with a major player)
- Crusader bug allowing you to avoid a Crusade if you put units surrounding Jerusalem (can no longer do that)

TODO:
- Rebalance Turkey, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland
- change Turkey UP (???) and remove the defensive bonuses from Constantinople
- make Religions hate each other even more
- Rebalance tech speed and starting techs
- Autorun gets one extra turn sometimes
- Protestant gets founded in Rome
- Look into pre-defined religions
- Expose the Civ names code to Python
