		<English>A philosophy and attempt to achieve ultimate wisdom, alchemy began in Classical Greece but developed in Persia and later  Europe during the Middle Ages. The goals of the alchemist were the "transmutation" of common metals into gold or silver, the creation of an elixir of life and the search for a universal solvent, and the quest to find the "philosophers stone" in the pursuit of these goals. Alchemists like Paracelsus and Issac Newton enjoyed great prestige and made contributions to early chemical processes like ore-testing and refining, metallurgy and the production of gunpowder, dyes, ceramics and glass. And the Islamic alchemists like Geber and al Kindi also laid the important foundations of modern scientific chemistry.</English>

		<English>The Islamic world from the 9thC experienced a Golden Age of science and learning in which scholars translated all the world's knowledge into Arabic. Thousands of works from Greece, Rome and India were preserved and studied by Muslim scholars who developed from them even greater scientific, mathematical and astronomical achievements. For over 500 years Islamic knowledge in every field surpassed anything else in the world, including the astronomical advances of Al Biruni; the introduction of numerals and invention of algebra by Al Khwarizmi; the optical breakthroughs of al Haytham and the development of modern chemistry by Geber, of whom Issac Newton may have referred when he said, "I have stood upon the shoulders of giants".</English>

		<English>As a process, architecture involves the designing and constructing buildings which first evolved to address the human needs of shelter, security and worship. Texts on architecture first appeared in Classical Greece and Rome and continued throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. With the Renaissance, buildings were constructed by individual designers and master builders like Brunelleschi, Michelangelo and Inigo Jones, combining the functions of artist, architect and engineer. As scientific knowledge advanced with the use of new materials and technologies, architecture and civil engineering began to diverge, allowing the architects like Bernini, Palladio and Christopher Wren to concentrate on the more aesthetic aspects of building design.</English>

		<English>Aristocracy refers to a form of government where the most prominent citizens rule, or as the highest class in society which holds the bulk of land, money and power. In Europe during the Middle Ages, a hereditary class of arbitrary rulers became known as the "nobility". In the feudal system, these nobles normally held a "fief" under "vassalage",ie. property and wealth in exchange for allegiance and military service to the Monarch or Lord and became a ruling caste holding a hereditary title, enjoying fiscal, political and other privileges. The military power of the aristocracy gradually declined as Kings began to organize cohesive national armies and their economic power declined with the rise of the urban merchant classes.</English>

Worn as a shirt, it is known as a "hauberk", normally knee-length but often shorter. It also take the form of leggings, hoods, mittens or collars. Mail seems to have emerged in both East Asia and Europe around 400BC and featured prominently throughout the Dark Ages and into the Middle Ages, reaching its apex in Europe during the 13thC were mail often covered the whole body. Plate armour, however, gradually began to replace mail in the 14th.C as it offered more effective protection against archery, pikes and early firearms. Mail did continue much longer however as a protective clothing for foot soldiers as late as the 18thC.</English>

		<English>As an expression of the medieval institution of knighthood, chivalry embodied the ideals of knightly virtue, duty, honour and courtly love. The term originated in 10th.C France from the word "chevalier" for knight, a powerful warrior with military training, a horse and equipment with sufficient wealth and prestige to support him. Chivalry was mainly associated with the occupation, duties and social class of the knight but from the 12thC, chivalry was also seen as a moral, religious and social code of knightly conduct, esp. with the development of knightly orders like the Templars and Hospitallers during the Crusades, and with the practice of heraldry and its elaborate rules of displaying personal and family coats of arms.</English>

Many types of water clock were known in China, Babylon and Egypt though these were refined by the Greeks and Romans and developed further in the Byzantine and Islamic period. In the Middle Ages as religious institutions sought to regulate the hours of prayer and work, came the development of "escapement" or weight-driven clocks and the use of the astrolabe in astronomical clocks. A further refinement arose in Calileo's invention of the pendulum clock and early attempts in spring-driven clocks which culminated in the invention of the marine chronometer by John Harrison in 1761.</English>

		<English>The flintlock firing mechanism in early firearms, invented in France about 1630, gradually replaced the more primitive matchlock and wheel-lock mechanisms. Flintlocks could be small-arm long guns or pistols, rifled or smoothbore, muzzle-loading or breech-loading. Flintlock muskets became the mainstay of European armies between 1660 and 1840 and were generally muzzle-loading, smoothbore long guns firing a round lead ball. Flintlock pistols were most often self-defense weapons, employed in dueling and as a cavalry arm in conjunction with swords and cutlasses. It was only with the invention of paper and metal cartridges and the development of multi-shot revolvers and rifles in the mid 19thC that flintlocks became obsolete.</English>

Flintlock muskets became the mainstay of European armies between 1660 and 1840 and were generally muzzle-loading, smoothbore long guns firing a round lead ball. Flintlock pistols were most often self-defense weapons, employed in dueling and as a cavalry arm in conjunction with swords and cutlasses.

Until the 14thC its use was confined to the Mediterranean Sea while Atlantic and Balkan vessels relied on the square sail. But it was the Portugese who first used large lateen sails in ocean-going caravels and the larger carrick with its mixed arrangement of both lateen and square rigging which became the mainstay of Atlantic voyages by the early European discoverers.

		<English>Monasticism is the religious practice in which individuals renounce worldly pursuits in favour of more spiritual work. The practice developed early in Christianity and monasteries were founded throughout early Europe to organize their followers in orders based on the rules laid down by St. Benedict, St. Dominic and others. Monasteries were communities whose members engaged in prayer, study and contemplation but also cooperated in the production of books and manuscripts, metallurgy, agriculture, textiles and brewing. Monasteries often became very powerful and wealthy communities whose influence could  challenge the more secular authorities such as the landed nobility, the military and the king or even the Church itself.</English>

		<Russian>A "standing" or professional army is comprised of full-time soldiers who "stand over" or do not disband in peacetime. Standing armies were better trained, equipped and prepared for battle, as defined in the "Marian" reforms which transformed the earlier property-based citizen army of the Roman Republic into a full-time professional Roman Army based on a period of service.

		<English>Public works are construction or engineering projects carried out by the state on behalf of the community which might include roads, canals, dams, harbours or city walls. Many great public projects were carried out by the Roman emperors to enhance their power and prestige and secure favour with the public like arenas, stadiums, public baths, theatres and libraries. In Europe during the Middle Ages, powerful kings, wealthy families and the Christian monasteries all supplied the wealth to finance the building of churches, cathedrals, castles, schools and transportation networks. As governments grew in power and influence and were able to raise tax revenues the building of public works became increasingly collective and national.</English>

		<English>Sacred or religious art was intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual as an object venerated not for what it was but what it represented. The use of art in religion was essential in symbolizing concepts or feelings that words alone could not express. Christian art was usually allusive, or built on familiar images, like the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, or Christ on the cross. As most people could not read, an elaborate iconograghic style in depicting religious themes was developed with Biblical events representing parables or lessons for the audience. Islamic art, however, forbade natural images but used geometric or calligraphic devices which emphasized the spiritual essence rather than the physical form.</English>

		<English>The most distinguishing feature of Renaissance art which developed in 14thC. Europe was its highly realistic and linear perspective, first demonstrated in the writings of the architect Leon Battista Alberti. Painters like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael studied the effects of light, shadow, colour and anatomy in their aesthetic attempt to depict the beauty of Nature. Paintings by Botticelli, Donatello and Titian were generally Classical or religious in theme though a vibrant artistic culture with more natural and rustic themes developed in the Netherlands in works by Van Eyck, Vermeer and Breughel and the German artists Durer and Holbein who themselves influenced the further development of the Italian style.</English>

Defending both the French and American Revolutions from critics like Edmund Burke and others, Paine's ideas followed logically from those of Jean Jacques Rousseau in "The Social Contract" (1762) where he outlined the basis of legitimate political order in a republican context with sovereignty lying in the hands of the people based on definable laws. Paine also opposed the continuation of hereditary government, preferring a natural progression to representative democracy based on an agreed and written constitution.</English>

		<English>The stirrup is a flat-bottomed ring fixed to a leather strap hanging on either side of a saddle to create a footrest for a person riding a horse, both as a support and an aid in mounting. Greatly improving the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and controlling his mount, it increased the animal's usefulness in communication, transportation and warfare. As a key factor in the creating and spreading of civilization, it may be just as important as the wheel and the printing press. Originating in China about 200AD it spread into Europe by the 7thC. and was widely adopted in the Middle Ages. With the rise of the armoured mounted knight and his retainers, it may also have helped initiate the development of the European feudal system.</English>

		<English>As a  type of public or joint-stock company, trading companies generally put their shares for sale on the open market and were "listed" on the stock exchange. An early example was the Virginia Company, combining the overseas interests of the London Company and the Plymouth Company which established the colonies of Jamestown and Popham on the east coast of America. Also about 1600, the Dutch East India Company and the Honourable East India Company of England were established to develop favourable trade contacts and advantages in India and the East Indies. Similar companies were established in South America and the West Indies by Spain, Portugal, Britain, Holland and Denmark to exploit their trade interests in those regions.</English>

		<English>A vassal, as developed during the rise of feudalism in Europe, was someone who enjoyed mutual rights and obligations with a lord or monarch, usually of military support and protection in exchange for guarantees which might entitle him to a certain terrain or "fief". Vassalage might involve an elaborate ceremony composed of declarations of homage and fealty backed by the Christian sacraments which formalized the concepts of lordship or "seigneurship" in a recognized pattern of individual social standing in the European Middle Ages. Increasingly society began to be organized around an elaborate pattern of overlapping hierarchies where each individual was bound by mutual rights, duties, honour and his own clearly defined obligations.</English>

		<English>A vault is an architectural term for an arched form used to provide space with a ceiling or roof. The parts of a vault exert a thrust that require a counter resistance which is provided by the soil if built below ground but requires various means such as barreled or continuous vaults combined with buttresses to supply the extra needed resistance. Particularly in the Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque cathedrals of the European Middle ages, barrel vaults were replaced or supplemented by the introduction of more elaborate forms such as groin vaults, rib vaults, fan vaults and transverse ribbing which allowed the creation of higher, wider ceilings and open spaces that typified the greatest architectural wonders of European history.</English>
