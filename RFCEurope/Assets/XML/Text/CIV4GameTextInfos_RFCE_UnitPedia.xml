		<English>Since a Medieval spear required only a small amount of steel along the sharpened edges, it was an economical weapon. Quick to manufacture, and needing less smithing skill than a sword, it became the common weapon of the peasantry in many parts of the world. With the rise of heavy cavalry, spear shafts began to be planted against the ground to deter charging cavalry. Spears morphed into different pole-arms as mounted knights became more important on the battlefields of Europe and a means to counter them was needed.</English>

		<English>A guisarme was a pole weapon used in Europe to dismount knights and horsemen, primarily between 1000-1400. Like most polearms it was developed by peasants by combining hand tools with long poles: in this case by putting a pruning hook onto a spear shaft. Later designs implemented a small reverse spike on the back of the blade, increasing the weapon's stopping power. Eventually hooks were incorporated into a variety of different polearms and guisarme became a catch-all for any weapon that included a hook on the blade.</English>

		<English>Early in the middle ages, the pike was only useful on defense; its length made it difficult for untrained soldiers to use in formation. The Swiss brought a renaissance to pike warfare in the 15th century, with strong training regimens and drummers to aid coordination. Now pike blocks could both rise to the attack and go into an impenetrable defensive formation when attacked by cavalry. The deep pike attack column remained an essential part of infantry combat for several hundred years.</English>

		<English>Swords in antiquity and classical times tended to be relatively short, at first because they were made of bronze and later because they were rarely called upon to penetrate armor. The blade of the classic Roman stabbing sword, the gladius, was only some two feet long, though in the twilight years of the empire the gladius gave way to the spatha, the long slashing sword of the barbarians and forerunner of the great broadswords of medieval Europe. During the Early Middle Ages, European swords tended to be long and straight, with no crossguard to protect the wielder's hand.</English>

		<English>The Longsword is a type of European sword used during the late medieval period. Made to counter the increasingly strong armor of the time, the longsword was commonly held in combat with both hands, though some may be used single-handed. A man-at-arms or dismounted knight fighting with a longsword would also have worn substantial other armor, such as a mail hauberk and helm. The terms "hand-and-a-half sword", "greatsword", and "bastard sword" are used colloquially to refer to longswords in general.</English>

The only real requirement for these units is that they be able to cover great distances and escape from situations in which they would be killed. Specially trained or bred horses are not required, and the unit needs to be only minimally armored. Before the development of the stirrup and other equestrian technology, it took years to learn to fight from horseback effectively, not a worthwhile investment for scouting units.</English>

		<English>A seargent, or serjeant, was a man of lesser rank and wealth to a knight, but with comparable equipment and training. Serjeants could fight either as heavy or light cavalry, and here fulfill that secondary role. Serjeants ranked above the common man-at-arms on the social scale. Although the social structure of the Norman society of England was generally static, the easiest manner for a man to attain social rank and improve his standing was through military service, as the Norman states, unlike the Germanic ones, believed in knighting men of common birth who demonstrated nobility and courage on the field. </English>

		<English>The Carolingians of early medieval France relied heavily on mounted warriors in their conquests. Inventions such as the stirrup and high-backed saddle are sometimes identified as the key element driving the shift from infantry to cavalry. Although these technologies were certainly useful in fighting from horseback, strategic considerations are just as likely to have driven the shift; the extended Carolingian empire required a mobile army. These early cavalry were protected with a byrnie (probably long scale armor) and fought primarily with lance and sword.</English>

The earliest Cuirassiers, born in the 15th century, were armored head-to-toe and armed with heavy saber and pistols. As European warfare began to rely more on firearms, much of this heavy armor was shed to increase mobility, eventually adapting into what is now recognized as the standard Cuirassier uniform - a breastplate and helm.</English>

Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force and range.

Although small by modern standards, the Carrack afforded enough space for crew, cargo and small cannons. Because the ship rose high out of the water it was near impossible for smaller ships to board a carrack. This size was a double edged sword, and due to its height Carracks were prone to capsize in strong winds. The Carrack was used most prominently by the Portuguese and Spanish during their explorations in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Ardent in the belief that all other religions are wrong, the Prosecutor lives to destroy the beliefs of others. If the Prosecution convicted a person of heresy, the personal property of a condemned person was confiscated and places of worship were destroyed; based on medieval and feudal laws. Usually the confiscated property was divided three ways: by the Prosecution members, the church officials, and the state treasury. The Church and state kept strict accounts of the prisoner's incarceration, trial and execution costs. If the value of his confiscated property was not enough to cover these costs, then his heirs had to pay the difference. Records show many women and children were left penniless from such confiscation.  You may expend a Prosecutor inside a city to remove all religions from that city except your own.</English>

Depending largely on plunder for their livelihood they were organized in bands similiar to mercenary companies which attracted religious zealots and adventurers of every kind. Within the context of Islamic jihad warfare, they struck fast and hard inside enemy borders to destroy war materials and morale, then withdrawing with all the loot they could carry. As flexible and highly mobile border defenders and raiders they often preceeded the deployment of much larger armies during the early Arab invasions of Persia, Egypt and North Africa.</English>

Dragoons were originally infantrymen deployed by horse, but later became cavalry. They were therefore trained in horse riding as well as infantry fighting skills. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Originally dragoons were considered as separate from regular cavalry, but during the 18th century they evolved into conventional mounted troops trained to fight from horseback.</English>

In Byzantine usage, the term came to refer exclusively to the professional, standing troops, garrisoned in and around the capital of Constantinople. Most of them traced their origins to the Imperial guard units of the later Roman Empire. By the 7th century, these had declined to little more than parade troops, meaning that the emperors were hard put to face the frequent revolts of the new and powerful thematic formations, especially the Opsician theme, the Asian theme closest to the capital. Within the first sixty years since its creation, it was involved in five revolts, culminating in the rebellion and usurpation of the throne by its commander, the Count Artabasdos, in 741 - 743.</English>

		<English>The Tercio ("one third"), also known as Tercio Español, was a Renaissance era military formation similar to and derivative of the Swiss pike square and was a term used to describe a mixed infantry formation of about 3,000 pikemen, swordsmen and arquebusiers in a mutually supportive formation; it was also sometimes referred to by other nations as a Spanish Square after its introduction by the Spanish army, and was widely adopted across international lines and dominated formalized field warfare for more than a century.

The Tercio Español was the product of the Italian Wars in which the Spanish general, Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, would reorganize the Spanish army throughout a series of conflicts at the end of the 15th and early 16th centuries, into a tactically unique combination of modern and medieval combined arms centered around armored infantry. This emphasis on the infantry was the result of Spain's great dependence on mules in daily life, which in turn resulted in an inability to raise large cavalry forces. It marked the transformation of medieval military institutions into the early modern combined-arms[3] army. (See: Pike and Shot for an excellent description of the eventual formation.) Gonzalo Fernández, developed the Tercio to further increase the effectiveness of Spanish infantry against every manner of opposing infantry while remaining impervious to the dangers of a cavalry charge.
At first the army consisted of units of around 6000 men, called coronelias, which by 1534 had been reduced into the Tercios of 3000 for increased mobility on the offensive.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_VENICE_GALLEAS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>The galleass or "galliass" developed from large merchant galleys converted for military use they were higher and larger than regular ("light") galleys. They had up to 32 oars, each worked by up to 5 men. They usually had three masts and a forecastle and aftcastle. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys. The gun-deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, but there are also pictures showing the opposite arrangement.

Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys, and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, but coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, exposed an attacker to her gunfire. The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. Relatively few galleasses were built - one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed - but they were used at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona). In the 15th century a type of light galleass, called the frigate, was built in southern European countries to answer the increasing challenge posed by the north African based Barbary pirates in their fast galleys.

In the Mediterranean, with its shallower waters, less dangerous weather and fickle winds, both galleasses and galleys continued in use, particularly in Venice and Turkey, long after they became obsolete elsewhere. Later, "round ships" and galleasses were replaced by galleons and ships of the line which originated in Atlantic Europe. The first Venetian ship of the line was built in 1660.</English>

The longbow combined long range and high accuracy but not both at the same time. Most longbow shooting involved launching volleys of arrows at enemy armies at long range from protected positions. The longbow was the machine gun of the Middle Ages, accurate, deadly and more rapid-firing than the crossbow or even early firearms though with the development of the latter the longbow gradually fell into disuse.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_HUNGARIAN_LANCER_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>A type of irregular light horsemen was already well established by the 15th century in medieval Hungary. Etymologists are divided over the derivation of the word 'hussar'. Many scholars believe the word that was passed into Hungarian by way of the Croatians originates from the Latin word 'cursus' meaning 'raid'. According to Webster's the word hussar stems from the Hungarian huszár, which in turn originates from the Serbian husar or gusar, meaning pirate, from the Medieval Latin cursarius (cf. the English word corsair). A variant of this theory is offered by Byzantinist scholars, who argue the term originated in Roman military practice, and the cursarius--a group of fast moving horsemen used for scouting or raiding-came to be called tsanarioi in Greek or the Armenian Chosarioi.  Through Byzantine Army operations in the Balkans in the 10th and 11th centuries, the word was thus reintroduced to Western European military practice after its original usage had been lost with the collapse of Rome in the west. According to another theory, the word is derived from the Hungarian word of húsz meaning twenty, suggesting that hussar regiments were originally composed of twenty men. Or the term huszár probably signified 'one in twenty' as selected for service by ballot.

The hussars reportedly originated in bands of Hungarian and Serbian warriors crossing into southern Hungary after the Turkish invasion of Serbia at the end of the 14th century. The Governor of Hungary, Hunyadi János - John Hunyadi, created mounted units inspired by his enemy the Ottoman Turks. His son, Hunyadi Mátyás Matthias Corvinus, later king of Hungary, is unanimously accepted as the creator of these troops. Initially they fought in small bands, but were reorganized into larger, trained, formations during the reign of King Matthias I Corvinus of Hungary. So the first Hussar regiments were the light cavalry of the Black Army of Hungary. Under his command the hussars took part in the war against the Ottoman Empire in 1485 and proved successful against the Turkish Spahis as well as against Bohemians and Poles. After the king's death in 1490, hussars remained the preferred form of cavalry in Hungary. The Habsburg emperors hired Hungarian hussars as mercenaries to serve against the Ottoman Empire and on various battlefields throughout Europe. The "father" of the US cavalry in 1777 was a Hungarian hussar named Kováts Mihály - Michael de Kovats.</English>

		<English>Field artillery is a type of mobile artillery used to suppport armies in the field, offering mobility, tactical proficiency and specializing in long or short range bombardment. Until the 19thC. they were known as foot artillery, for while the guns were pulled by beasts of burden (often horses), their crews marched on foot providing fire support for the infantry, unlike the later horse artillery, with their emphasis on speed. who supported cavalry units with their lighter guns and their crews travelling on horseback. Early artillery were unsuited to the battlefield, as the extremely massive pieces could not be easily moved except in areas under friendly control. Thus their principal role was limited to functions like breaking seiges.
The first field artillery were developed with advances in metallurgy which allowed thinner barrels able to withstand explosive forces without bursting, thus making them considerably lighter. But there was always the risk that constant changes on the battlefield would leave slow-moving artillery units behind. making them vulnerable to enemy cavalry who often specialized in seeking them out and destroying them. It was only with invention of the limber, pulled by horses hitched to a wheeled artillery piece, in the 18thC., that the concept of field artillery become truly established.</English>

The Ottoman Empire became the first in Europe to put gunpowder into widespread use in both hand weaponry and seige cannons. The army of Mehmet I which conquered Constantinople in 1453 included foot soldiers armed with matchlock muskets and bombard artillery of various sizes. The barrage of Ottoman cannon fire, from 69 guns firing over 19,000 times, is said to have lasted for at least 40 days.
Amongst these were a number of extremely large and powerful seige bombards. Bombards had been deployed by many European armies since the late 1300's but the Ottoman siege guns were especially massive and powerful "superguns", like the "Dardanelles Gun" or Great Turkish Bombard, weighing over 18 tons and firing huge stone or iron projectiles of over 2 feet in diameter. This famous gun along with many others, remained in use by the Ottomans until the early 19thC.,even causing serious damage to British naval operations against the Ottomans in 1807.

Like cogs, they were generally flat-bottomed and square-sailed with overlapping "strakes" or planks at each end and full lapstrakes covering the sides. Their keels were shallow and their sternpost straight and long with a stern-mounted central rudder similiar to those in the cog. Improvements in wood-working techniques allowed a transition from smaller cogs to holks of greater capacity until both were overtaken by the development of the carrack and caravel in the late 14thC.
The holk was probably a fairly minor type of boat and largely confined to the Low Countries and the Baltic where it was used originally as a river or canal boat with a limited potential for sea cruising. Even so, for a period in the 14thC. holks began to evolve into larger examples which exceeded the cog in both size and capacity, if not in ocean-going sea-worthiness and the holk remained a major load carrier in the medieval economy well into the 16thC..</English>

		<English>A galley is a type of ship that can be propelled entirely by human oarsmen and used for warfare and trade, but usually had masts and sails for use when the wind was favourable. various types of galleys dominated naval warfare in the Meditteranean Sea from the 8thC.BC to the 16thC. Many medieval states, notably Venice, Genoa, the Byzantines, Arabs and the Ottoman Turks depended largely on heavily-armed galleys until the introduction of the ocean-going "man-of-war". The Battle of Lepanto, in 1571, was one of the largest and last sea battles in which galleys played the principal part.
Galleys remained in regular use in the Meditteranean until the introduction of broadside sailing ships in the 17thC.. While war galleys originally carried archers and slingers for offensive operations and defence, the advent of gunpowder weapons saw the development of early cannons mounted on ships. In fact, medieval war galleys pioneered the use of naval guns, with the typical Venetian gun galley or "laterna" mounting high calibe guns in the bow and stern with various lighter swivel guns deployed throughout the ship. However, with the development of the high-sided carrack and galleas capable of powerful broadside cannonfire, the usefulness of these gun galleys eventually came to an end.</English>

Fighting in close order squares these disciplined combined arms units were feared on the battlefield throughout Europe.
Increasingly in the 18thC. line infantry units became wholly equiped with accurate long-range firearms and were deployed as integrated units. Typically, specialist companies were deployed on the flanks of the main body of musket-armed infantry with a company of light infantry trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield and a company of grenadiers, who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the regiment, deployed in advance as the lead assault troops. Regiments of these line infantry remained the mainstay of all European armies until the beginning of the 20thC.</English>

The first curassiers wore three-quarter armour which covered the upper body and a close helm or "lobster-tail" pot helmet with the torso protected by breast and back plates, worn above long riding boots. Weapons included a pair of pistols in saddle holsters, a short sword or sabre and often a light mace or war hammer. 
The first curassiers were formed as a regiment of Austrian kurassiers (or "kyrissers") recruited from Croatia in 1484 to serve the future Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian. Austrian Kurassiers also fought the Swedes and their allies at Lutzen in 1632, killing their king Gustavus Adolphus during the battle. The armour worn by the Kurassiers gradually decreased throughout the 18thC. until the Napoleonic Wars so that the Kurassiers, like other curassiers, wore little more than helmets and breast plates. Kurassiers played a prominent role in the armies of Austria during the campaigns of Frederick the Great and remained the senior members of the mounted branch of the army, retaining their status as "big men on horses" throughout the 19thC. and beyond.</English>

		<English>A grenadier (from the word "grenade") was originally a specialized soldier who threw explosive grenades and sometimes took part in assault operations on the field of battle. From the 17thC. grenadiers were chosen from the largest and strongest soldiers and often led the storming of breaches in seige warfare, a role later performed by sappers and pioneers. Grenades were small iron spheres, the size of a baseball or cricket ball, filled with gunpowder and fused by a slow match. The wide hats worn by grenadiers were gradually replaced by tall caps shaped like a bishop's mitre which permitted the grenadier greater ease in throwing the grenade overhand.
Grenade usage declined in the late 18thC. although the need for elite assault troops remained and grenadiers were retained for this purpose and specially selected for their strength, experience and steadiness under fire. All the major European
armies continued to employ elite grenadier companies until the early 19thC.. Their use was particularly marked in the battles of the Dutch Republic from 1648 to the 1790s as Dutch grenadiers wearing their distinctive guilded "bishop's mitres" saw action in numerous battles during the Anglo-Dutch wars. Grenadiers remained prominent on the battlefield until the invasion and occupation of the Netherlands by Revolutionary France in 1795.</English>

Norsemen developed the longship, a clinker-built narrow, sleek galley of shallow draught capable of travelling on inland rivers as well as being extremely seaworthy on the open ocean under sail. Longships became the epitome of Norse naval power
and remained dominant in Northern Europe until the introduction of the cog and the carrack in the 14thC..
War galleys, as employed in the Meditteranean, were less capable of ocean voyages but ideal for shallow waters and near-shore navigation and soon grew considerably in size and firepower. The largest examples were rowed by nearly 300 men and carried a further 400 crew and fighting soldiers as well as dozens of cannons of all sizes. By the late 16thC. the large war galleys became mostly obsolete by the man-of-war although they remained the mainstay of the North African "corsair" pirate fleets and

Their victory at Manzikert in 1071 was a decisive defeat for the Byzantine Empire and soon all of Syria and Anatolia came under Seljuk control. Seljuk petty kingdoms were set up throughout the region, notably the Sultanate of Rum in eastern Anatolia which remained in existence until the 14thC. Their fractured states, however, were more concerned with consolidating their territories and conquering their neighbours than cooperating against the First Crusade. Although they easily defeated the untrained "Peoples Crusade" in 1096 they could not prevent the main Crusader army from seizing important cities like Nicaea, Iconium and Antioch, capturing the Holy Land in 1099 and setting up the first of the Crusader kingdoms.</English>

		<English>The term "Highlander" refers to the Gaelic-speaking inhabitants of the northern uplands and western isles of Scotland who are descended from original Picts and Scots before the 10thC., becoming increasingly distinct from the "Lowlanders" of southern Scotland, with their traditional Gaelic language and customs. Organized in clans led by chiefs or "lairds", they were known as fierce warriors armed with swords, axes and small shields, wearing little else but their short skirt or "kilt" woven in their distinctive clan pattern or "tartan". Although they supported Robert the Bruce in the unification of Scotland and its independence following the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, the highland clans remained resistant to any central government.
The Stewart dynasty ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages, managing to retain the loyalty of the fierce Highland clans despite their growing resentment of the increasingly Protestant and Anglophile Scottish lowlands. Clan resistance to British rule erupted after the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707 in support of the Stewart pretender "Bonnie Prince Charlie" until the Scottish highlanders were finally decisively beaten at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. The Scottish Highlands were effectively cleared and replaced with sheep in the late 18thC. while most highlanders were deported to the colonies, mainly Canada and Australia, where many retain their language and customs to this day.</English>
