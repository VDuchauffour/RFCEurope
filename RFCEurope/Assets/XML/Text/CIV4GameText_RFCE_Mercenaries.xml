		<English>[TAB]The tagma is a term for a military unit of battalion size. The best-known use of the term however refers to the elite regiments comprising the central imperial army of the middle and late Byzantine Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Byzantine usage, the term came to refer exclusively to the professional, standing troops, garrisoned in and around the capital of Constantinople. Most of them traced their origins to the Imperial guard units of the later Roman Empire. By the 7th century, these had declined to little more than parade troops, meaning that the emperors were hard put to face the frequent revolts of the new and powerful thematic formations, especially the Opsician theme, the Asian theme closest to the capital. Within the first sixty years since its creation, it was involved in five revolts, culminating in the rebellion and usurpation of the throne by its commander, the Count Artabasdos, in 741 - 743.</English>

		<English>[TAB]From the French "corsaire" for privateer, the Barbary Pirates, often known as "Turkish corsairs" were Muslim pirates operating from the North African ports of Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers and part of Morocco in an area which became known as the Barbary Coast. Their attacks even extended into the Atlantic as far north as Ireland and Iceland as they destroyed thousands of Venetian, French, Spanish and English ships from the time of the Crusades until the beginning of the early 1800s. Long stretches of coastline in Italy, Spain and France were almost abandoned for centuries as the pirates captured nearly a million Europeans as slaves between the 16th and 19th century to be sold in the slave markets of North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Among the most famous corsairs were the brothers Hayreddin Barbarossa and Oruc Reis, who took control of the port of Algiers in the 15th century. beginning 400 years of Ottoman presence in North Africa and establishing a centre of Mediterranean piracy, nominally under Ottoman control but self-governing and funded largely by piracy. Many of these Barbary corsairs, sailing in their large war galleys or "Xebecs" were originally Europeans, often former Dutch captives recruited as pirates, and operated with the cooperation of some European powers, like the French against the Spanish or the British and Dutch against the French. Most European nations paid ransom and tribute to the Barbary pirates until the beginning of the 19th century when concerted French, British and American naval actions finally suppressed their fleets and bases and Algiers was captured by the French in 1830.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The term "Highlander" refers to the Gaelic-speaking inhabitants of the northern uplands and western isles of Scotland who are descended from original Picts and Scots before the 10th century, becoming increasingly distinct from the "Lowlanders" of southern Scotland, with their traditional Gaelic language and customs. Organized in clans led by chiefs or "lairds", they were known as fierce warriors armed with swords, axes and small shields, wearing little else but their short skirt or "kilt" woven in their distinctive clan pattern or "tartan". Although they supported Robert the Bruce in the unification of Scotland and its independence following the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, the highland clans remained resistant to any central government.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Stewart dynasty ruled Scotland for the remainder of the Middle Ages, managing to retain the loyalty of the fierce Highland clans despite their growing resentment of the increasingly Protestant and Anglophile Scottish lowlands. Clan resistance to British rule erupted after the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707 in support of the Stewart pretender "Bonnie Prince Charlie" until the Scottish highlanders were finally decisively beaten at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. The Scottish Highlands were effectively cleared and replaced with sheep in the late 18th century while most highlanders were deported to the colonies, mainly Canada and Australia, where many retain their language and customs to this day.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Following the Norman conquest of Wales in the 13th century, during which Welsh bowmen caused heavy casualties to the invader, Kings of England increasingly began to used longbowmen, including Welsh bowmen in their armies. Originally the Welsh employed a much shorter, rougher bow made of elm technically distinct from the classic English yew longbows. But as soon as the Welsh campaign was successfully over, Welsh conscripts began to be incorporated in large numbers into English armies. The valuable lessons the English learned in Wales of the tactic of massed formations of skilled archers using powerful bows was later used with great effect by English and Welsh mercenary longbowmen on the battlefields of Scotland and France.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Condottieri (singular condottiero and condottiere) were the mercenary soldier leaders (or warlords) of the professional, military free companies contracted by the Italian city-states and the Papacy, from the late Middle Ages until the mid-16th century. In contemporary Italian, condottiero means "contractor", and is synonymous with the modern English title Mercenary Captain, which, historiographically, does not connote the hired soldier's nationality.[PARAGRAPH:2]These Italian words were standard usage in English writing of the Napoleonic times that remained current in the histories until the late 20th century; because formally-employed, standing, professional armies were uncommon until late in the Napoleonic Wars (1800-1815) thus, the word Condottiere in the English language has come to denote any hired soldier.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Italian city-states of Venice, Florence, and Genoa were very rich from their trade with the Levant, yet possessed woefully small national armies. In the event that foreign powers and envious neighbours attacked, the ruling nobles hired foreign mercenaries to fight for them. The military-service terms and conditions were stipulated in a condotta (contract) between the City-State and the Soldier (officer and enlisted man), thus, the contracted leader, the Mercenary Captain commanding, was titled the Condottiere.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the eleventh to the thirteenth century, European soldiers led by professional officers, fought against the Muslims in the Crusades (1095-1291). These officers provided large-scale warfare combat experience in the foreign Holy Land of the Asian Middle East. On the Crusades' conclusion, the first masnada (bands of roving soldiers) appeared; they were not Italian, but (mostly) German, from the Duchy of Brabant (hence, Brabanzoni), and from Catalonia and Aragon. The latter were Spanish soldiers who had followed King Peter III of Aragon to the Holy Land in October 1282, and, post-war, remained there, seeking military employment. In Italy, in 1333, other mercenaries arrived with John of Bohemia to fight, as the Compagnia della Colomba (Dove Company), Perugia's war against Arezzo. Given the profession, some masnade were less mercenaries than bandits and desperate men.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first organised mercenaries were the Ventura Companies of Duke Werner of Urslingen and Count Konrad von Landau. Werner's company differed from other mercenary companies because its code of military justice imposed discipline and an equal division of the contract's income. The Ventura Company increased in number until becoming the fearsome "Great Company" of some 3,000 barbute (each barbuta comprised a knight and a sergeant). To this, the Italian nobleman Lodrisio Visconti countered with the "Company of St. George"-featuring cavalrymen as the key fighting men, and not infantrymen. In Italy, the first mercenary army was led by Alberico da Barbiano, the Count of Conio, who later taught military science to condottieri such as Braccio da Montone and Giacomuzzo Attendolo Sforza.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once aware of their military power monopoly in Italy, the condottieri bands became notorious for their capriciousness, and soon dictated terms to their ostensible employers. In turn, many condottieri, such as Braccio da Montone and Muzio Sforza, became powerful politicians. As most were educated men acquainted with Roman military-science manuals (e.g. Vegetius's Epitoma rei militarii), they began viewing warfare from the perspective of military science, rather than that of guts (physical courage)-a great, consequential departure from chivalry, the traditional medieval model of soldiering. Consequently, the condottieri fought by out-manoeuvring the opponent and fighting his ability to wage war, rather than risk uncertain fortune-defeat, capture, death-in battlefield combat.[PARAGRAPH:2]The medieval condottieri developed the art of war (strategy and tactics) into military science more than any of their historical military predecessors-fighting indirectly, not directly-thus, only reluctantly endangering themselves and their enlisted men, avoiding battle when possible. As a political scientist, Niccolo Machiavelli mis-interpreted that condottieri fought each other in grandiose, but often pointless and near-bloodless battles. Militarily, the condottieri line of battle still deployed the grand armoured knight and medieval weapons and tactics after most European powers had begun employing professional standing armies of pikemen and musketeers.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1347, Cola di Rienzo (Tribune and effective dictator of the city) had Werner of Urslingen executed in Rome, and Konrad von Landau assumed command of the Great Company. In 1362, Count von Landau was betrayed by his Hungarian soldiers, and defeated in combat, by the White Company's more advanced tactics under commanders Albert Sterz and John Hawkwood. Stategically, the barbuta was replaced with the three-soldier, mounted lancia (a capo-lancia, a groom, and a boy); five lance composed a posta, five poste composed a bandiera (flag). By that time, the campaigning condottieri companies were as much Italian as foreign: the Astorre I Manfredi's Compagnia della Stella (Star Company); a new Company of St. George under Ambrogio Visconti; Niccolo da Montefeltro's Compagnia del Cappelletto (Little Hat Company); and the Compagnia della Rosa, commanded by Giovanni da Buscareto and Bartolomeo Gonzaga.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the fifteenth century hence, most condottieri were landless Italian nobles who had chosen the profession of arms as livelihood; the most famous of such mercenary captains was the son of Caterina Sforza, Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, from Forlì, known as The Last Condottiere; his son was Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany; besides noblemen, princes also fought as condottieri, given the sizable income to their estates, notably Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, and Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Condottiere (Singular, Plural: Condottieri) ist die Bezeichnung für einen Söldnerführer, wie ihn die italienischen Stadtstaaten vom späten Mittelalter bis in die Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts beschäftigten. Der Begriff leitet sich vom italienischen condottiero (Singular) beziehungsweise condottieri (Plural) ab. Die Form condottiere entsprach der im Italienischen bzw. Toskanischen um 1500 gebräuchlichen Form. Die italienische Mehrzahl ist international geworden, die Einzahl wird im Deutschen wiederum in Analogie zu anderen italienischen Berufsbezeichnungen mit der Endung -iere geformt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert waren italienische Stadtstaaten wie Venedig, Florenz und Genua durch ihren Orienthandel reich geworden. Diese Städte hatten aber nur schwache Streitkräfte und wurden so zum Angriffsziel fremder Mächte wie auch neidischer Nachbarn. Der regierende Adel suchte seine Länder durch das Anmieten von Söldnertruppen zu verteidigen, die einen condotta (Sold bzw. Soldvertrag) abschlossen und dann als compagnia di ventura bekannt waren. Jede compagnia wurde durch einen condottiero angeführt. Aufgrund ständiger interner Streitigkeiten zwischen den Adelsfamilien wurde auch die oberste Führung der Stadt oft für jeweils ein Jahr in die Hand auswärtiger Personen gegeben, die als Podestà bezeichnet wurden. Die Truppen der Condottieri waren für ihre Launen berüchtigt. Sie wechselten oft die Seiten für bessere Bezahlung, und dies nicht nur vor, sondern auch in der Schlacht. Die Condottieri rekrutierten sich auch von außerhalb Italiens. Während der Kampfpausen im Hundertjährigen Krieg verdingten sich viele Söldner in Italien. Schwäbische Niederadelige, welche ohne feste Lehensbindungen waren, zogen ebenfalls verstärkt über die Alpen. Die Condottieri spürten bald, dass sie ein Monopol auf die militärische Macht in Italien hatten, und begannen damit, ihren Arbeitgebern die Bedingungen zu diktieren. Viele Condottieri wie Braccio da Montone oder Muzio Attendolo Sforza wurden im 14. Jahrhundert mächtige Figuren auf der politischen Bühne. Währenddessen stellten sich die Condottieri nicht schnell genug auf moderne Methoden der Kriegsführung ein. Sie hielten an geharnischten Rittern und mittelalterlicher Bewaffnung und Taktik sogar noch fest, als in weiten Teilen Europas bereits moderne Armeen aus Pikenieren und Arkebusieren aufgestellt worden waren. Auch begannen sie damit, sich gegenseitig aus Prestigegründen in Schlachten zu verwickeln, die meist unblutig blieben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als 1494 französische Truppen in Italien einmarschierten und der Kirchenstaat Spanien zur Hilfe rufen musste, wurden die verschwenderisch geschmückten, aber wenig effektiven Condottieri von jeder der nacheinander einmarschierenden ausländischen Armeen geschlagen. Gegen Schweizer Pikeniere, französische Kavalleristen und spanische Arkebusiere konnten sie keine Verteidigung mehr bieten. Bis 1500 verschwanden die Condottieri und ihre Truppen daher völlig.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Swiss Guards is the name given to the Swiss soldiers who have served as bodyguards, ceremonial guards, and palace guards at foreign European courts since the late 15th century. In contemporary usage it refers to the Pontifical Swiss Guard of Vatican City. They have generally had a high reputation for discipline and loyalty to their employers. Apart from household and guard units, some formations have also served as fighting troops; regular Swiss mercenary regiments served as line troops in various armies, notably those of France, Spain and Naples up to the 19th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Various units of Swiss Guards have existed for hundreds of years. The earliest such detachment was the Swiss Hundred Guard (Cent-Garde) at the French court (1497-1830). This small force was complemented in 1567 by a Swiss Guard regiment. The Papal Swiss Guard in the Vatican was founded in 1506 and is the only Swiss Guard that still exists. In the 18th century several other Swiss Guards existed for periods in various European courts.[PARAGRAPH:2]The institution reflects the situation of Switzerland at the time. Unlike the present, Switzerland was a poor country whose young men often sought their fortunes abroad.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Corps of the Pontifical Swiss Guard or Swiss Guard (German: Schweizergarde, Italian: Guardia Svizzera Pontificia, Latin: Pontificia Cohors Helvetica, or Cohors Pedestris Helvetiorum a Sacra Custodia Pontificis) is something of an exception to the Swiss rulings of 1874 and 1927. It is a small force maintained by the Holy See and is responsible for the safety of the Pope, including the security of the Apostolic Palace. It serves as the de facto military of Vatican City.[PARAGRAPH:2]The history of the Swiss Guards has its origins in the 15th century. Pope Sixtus IV (1471-1484) already made a previous alliance with the Swiss Confederation and built barracks in Via Pellegrino after foreseeing the possibility of recruiting Swiss mercenaries. The pact was renewed by Innocent VIII (1484-1492) in order to use them against the Duke of Milan. Alexander VI (1492-1503) later actually used the Swiss mercenaries during their alliance with the King of France. During the time of the Borgias, however, the Italian Wars began in which the Swiss mercenaries were a fixture in the front lines among the warring factions, sometimes for France and sometimes for the Holy See or the Holy Roman Empire. The mercenaries enlisted when they heard King Charles VIII of France was going to raise a war against Naples. Among the participants in the war against Naples was Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II (1503-1513), who was well acquainted with the Swiss having been Bishop of Lausanne years earlier. The expedition failed in part thanks to new alliances made by Alexander VI against the French. When Cardinal della Rovere became pope Julius II in 1505, he asked the Swiss Diet to provide him with a constant corps of 200 Swiss mercenaries. In September 1505, the first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome, under the command of Kaspar von Silenen, and entered the city on January 22, 1506, today given as the official date of the Guard's foundation. "The Swiss see the sad situation of the Church of God, Mother of Christianity, and realize how grave and dangerous it is that any tyrant, avid for wealth, can assault with impunity, the common Mother of Christianity," declared Huldrych Zwingli, a Swiss Catholic who later became a Protestant reformer. Pope Julius II later granted them the title "Defenders of the Church's freedom".[PARAGRAPH:2]After the disbanding of the main Swiss mercenaries battalions, most of the former soldiers returned to Switzerland. In there, and after some effort, they were reintegrated to the rural life. An amend on the Swiss constitution on 1874 banning the recruitment of Swiss citizens by foreign powers put the final nail on the group, with the sole exception of the Papal guards.</English>

		<English>[TAB]It was because of Basil's distrust of the native Byzantine guardsmen, whose loyalties often shifted with fatal consequences, as well as the proven loyalty of the Varangians that led Basil to employ them as his personal bodyguards. This new force became known as the Varangian Guard. Over the years, new recruits from as far abroad as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway gave a predominantly Scandinavian cast to the organization until the late 11th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Composed primarily of Scandinavians for the first 100 years, the guard began to see increased inclusion of Anglo-Saxons after the successful invasion of England by the Normans, the earliest written record dating to 1088. At this time a large number of Anglo-Saxons and Danes emigrated to the Byzantine Empire by way of the Mediterranean. One source has more than 5,000 of them arriving in 235 ships. Those who did not enter imperial service were settled on the Black Sea, but those who did became so vital to the Varangians that it was commonly called the Englinbarrangoi from that point. In this capacity they were able to war against the Normans under Robert Guiscard in Sicily, who unsuccessfully sought to invade the lower Balkans as well.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Varangians served as the personal bodyguard of the emperor, swearing an oath of loyalty to him; they had ceremonial duties as retainers and acclaimers and performed some police duties, especially with regard to cases of treason and conspiracy. Other than their fierce loyalty, the most recognizable attributes of the Varangian guard during the 11th century were their large axes and their penchant for drinking. There are countless stories of the Varangian guard either drinking in excess or being drunk. In 1103 during a visit to Constantinople, King Eric of Denmark "exhorted members of the guard to lead a more sober life and not give themselves up to drunkenness." It is not surprising, due to this Varangian vice to find a 12th century description of them as "the Emperor's wine-bags."</English>

		<English>[TAB]Hakkapeliitta (plural Hakkapeliitat) was the term used in the Holy Roman Empire for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (a.k.a. Sweden-Finland) during the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648). A Hakkapeliitta was also known as a Hackapelit, Hackapelite, Haccapelit, or Haccapelite.[PARAGRAPH:2]The hakkapeliitat were first used during the Polish-Swedish Wars of the late 1500s. In the early 17th century the cavalry led by the Swedish-Finnish Field Marshal Jacob De la Gardie conquered the Russian cities Novgorod and Moscow. The Hakkapeliitta cavalry men led by the Finnish Field Marshal Gustaf Horn were vital to the Swedish victories in Germany during the Thirty Years' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Hakkapeliitat were well-trained Finnish light cavalrymen who excelled in sudden and savage attacks, raiding and reconnaissance. The term hakkapeliitta comes from the Finnish war cry hakkaa päälle (English: hack on or hit on; Swedish: hacka på), but most commonly translated as "Cut them down!"[PARAGRAPH:2]The greatest advantage of the fast and lightly-armored Hakkapeliitta cavalry was its charge. They typically had two pistols, a sword, a helmet, and leather armor or a breastplate of steel. They would attack at a full gallop, fire the first pistol at twenty paces and the second at five paces, and then draw the sword. The horse itself was used like another weapon, as it was used to trample enemy infantry.[PARAGRAPH:2]The horses used by the Hakkapeliitat were known as Finnhorses, a strong and durable breed larger than the neighboring Swedish counterpart.</English>

Ce nom leur vient de leur cri de guerre hakkaa päälle! « tape sur la tête » en finnois.[PARAGRAPH:2]Les hakkapélites montaient des chevaux finlandais. Le cavalier hakkapélite portait deux pistolets qu'il déchargeait l'un à vingt pas de l'adversaire, l'autre à cinq pas. Puis il tirait l'épée. La masse du cheval servait aussi à écraser l'infanterie ennemie au cours de la charge. Le Hakkapélite se protégeait d'un casque, et d'un vêtement de cuir (költeri) ou d'une cuirasse (kyrassi) sur la poitrine. La charge des Hakkapélites était difficile à contenir et décidait souvent du combat dès le premier contact. Par comparaison avec les engagements antérieurs, soit elle s'accompagnait d'un tir plus précis soit alors sa puissance de feu était plus concentrée au moment du choc. C'est ainsi que les Hakkapélites étaient capables de disloquer les carrés ou tercios de piques que l'on jugeait auparavant invincibles. Ils se montrèrent aussi capables d'affronter les cuirassiers impériaux plus lourdement équipés.</French>

A small number of the Doppelsöldner of each company were usually issued with firearms.[NEWLINE][TAB]Likewise, Landsknechts schooled in the use of the Zweihänder (two-hander), a massive two-handed sword, were entitled to double pay and thus qualified as Doppelsöldner. The fencing guild of the Brotherhood of St. Mark had the monopoly on the use of the Zweihänder after Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor granted it to them in 1487.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Zweihänder was allegedly used by the Doppelsöldner to break through formations of pikemen, especially Swiss pikemen, by either being swung to break the ends of the pikes themselves or to knock them aside and attack the pikemen directly. The factuality of this tradition is disputed, but at least as a legend, it appears to date to at least the 17th century.</English>

This mainly happened because the bulk of stradioti rank and file were of Albanian origin from regions of Greece, but by the middle of the 16th century there is evidence that many of them had been Hellenized and in some occasions even Italianized. Hellenization was possibly underway prior to service abroad, since stradioti of Albanian origin had settled in Greek lands for two generations before their emigration to Italy. Moreover, since many served under Greek commanders and together with the Greek stradioti, this process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in the places they lived in Italy.</English>

In the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, they were the mercenary corps rent by the directors of cities to protect the city against foreign troops.[NEWLINE][TAB]In August 1617, the States of Holland adopted a "Sharp Resolution", this resolution gave the cities in Holland the opportunity to hire Waardgelders on own hand, at the expense of the states, to prevent riots. In practice, the resolution was directed against the Counter-Remonstrants, a rebellious group among population in the cities. This, however, undermined the authority of Prince Maurice, commander of the army. This was Prince Maurice therefore not acceptable and he went to Utrecht to dismiss the Waardgelders on 31 July 1618.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1627, 8000 Waardgelders were hired for the Siege of Grol. Two years later, for the Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch, between 10000 and 11000 Waardgelders were hired.</English>

The Walloons formed an elite unit tasked with the interior security of Spain and the maintenance of public order, eventually being incorporated as a regiment of the Spanish Royal Guard.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Walloon Guards originated at a time when the Low Countries were under the Spanish Crown as the Spanish Netherlands. "Walloons" was the German (walah) name for their romanized neighbors. The first Walloon regiments were formed by the Flemish, the Brabantians and Walloons to the number of 4,000 men and were recruited among the strongest and tallest men available, to spearhead assaults or to cover retreats.[NEWLINE][TAB]The decision to raise a regiment of Walloon Guards was taken on 17 October 1702 by Philip V of Spain and the new unit arrived in Spain in December the following year. They were linked with the Spanish Guards (Gardes Espagnoles) raised shortly before. Both regiments had the same organisation, disciplinary regulations and uniforms of dark blue, red and silver. The model for both were the French Guards (Gardes Francais) of the French Maison du Roi, a detachment of whom were sent to Spain in 1703 to act as instructors.[NEWLINE][TAB]After the independence of the United Netherlands in 1648 and the cession of the Spanish Netherlands to Austria at the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Walloons continued to serve in the Spanish army together with foreign soldiers from Switzerland, Ireland, and Italy. The Walloon Guards remained a primarily Walloon unit, although the Austrian authorities attempted to discourage recruitment in the former Spanish Netherlands. Most officers of the Regiment came from Spanish families of Walloon origin.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Swiss mercenaries were valued through the Late Medieval Europe for their overall effectiveness in the use of pikes and halberd on formation. However, after having dominated the European battlefield for near a century, advances in tactics and the incorporation of firearms and artillery saw a decline in their effectiveness. In the following years, the Swiss mercenaries saw extensive changes in tactics, drill and weapons. The Swiss Line Infantry is the culmination of this process, and saw action on the French, Spanish, Dutch and British armies until their dissolution on the 1820-1830 period. Currently, the only remaining Swiss mercenary unit remaining are the Papal guards.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the disbanding of the main Swiss mercenaries battalions, most of the former soldiers returned to Switzerland. In there, and after some effort, they were reintegrated to the rural life. An amend on the Swiss constitution on 1874 banning the recruitment of Swiss citizens by foreign powers put the final nail on the group, with the sole exception of the Papal guards.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Lipka Tatars are a group of Tatars who originally settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the beginning of 14th century. The first settlers tried to preserve their shamanistic religion and sought asylum amongst the non-Christian Lithuanians. Towards the end of the 14th century, another wave of Tatars - this time, Muslims, were invited into the Grand Duchy by Vytautas the Great. These Tatars first settled in Lithuania proper around Vilnius, Trakai, Hrodna and Kaunas and later spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth. These areas comprise present-day Lithuania, Belarus and Poland. From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars. While maintaining their religion, they united their fate with that of the mainly Christian Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the Battle of Grunwald onwards the Lipka Tatar light cavalry regiments participated in every significant military campaign of Lithuania and Poland.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Lipka Tatar origins can be traced back to the descendant states of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan - the White Horde, the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate and Kazan Khanate. They initially served as a noble military caste but later they became urban-dwellers known for their crafts, horses and gardening skills. Throughout centuries they resisted assimilation and kept their traditional lifestyle. While they remained very attached to their religions, over time however, they lost their original Tatar language and for the most part adopted Polish. There are still small groups of Lipka Tatars living in today's Belarus, Lithuania and Poland, as well as their communities in United States.</English>

After taking Damascus, Hulagu demanded that Qutuz surrender Egypt but Qutuz had Hulagu's envoys killed and, with Baibars' help, mobilized his troops. Although Hulagu pulled the majority of his forces out of Syria to attend the kurultai when great Khan Möngke died in action against the Southern Song, he left his lieutenant, the Christian Kitbuqa, in charge with a token force of about 18,000 men as a garrison. Qutuz drew the Ilkhanate army into an ambush near the Orontes River, routed them at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 and captured and executed Kitbuqa.[PARAGRAPH:2]After this great triumph, Qutuz was assassinated by conspiring Mamluks. It was said that Baibars, who seized power, was involved in the assassination. In the following centuries the rule of mamluks was discontinuous, with an average span of seven years.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Mamluks defeated the Ilkhanates a second time in the First Battle of Homs and began to drive them back east. In the process they consolidated their power over Syria, fortified the area, and formed mail routes and diplomatic connections between the local princes. Baibars's troops attacked Acre in 1263, captured Caesarea in 1265, and took Antioch in 1268.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mamluks also defeated new Ilkhanate attacks in Syria in 1271 and 1281 (Second Battle of Homs). They were defeated by the Ilkhanates and their Christian allies at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299, but soon after that the Mamluks defeated the Ilkhanate again in 1303/1304 and 1312. Finally, the Ilkhanates and the Mamluks signed a treaty of peace in 1323.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Serbian army was feudal in nature, though its system of military landholding was inherited from the Byzantine pronoia rather than the Western European fief. The pronoia itself - hereditary by some accounts, non-hereditary by others - is only first recorded in Serbia under that name in 1299 (the Serbs spelt it pronija, or pronya, and called its holder a promjar), but even from as early as Stefan Nemanja reign (1186-96) every able-bodied man possessing a bashtina (a grant of hereditary freehold land, the holder being called a bashtinik or voynici) had been obliged to attend the army whenever required, only monastic tenants being exempted in exchange for performing part-time garrison duties in local fortresses and fortified monasteries. The building and maintenance (gradozadanje) of such fortresses, and equally the maintenance of their permanent garrisons (gradobljudenlje) was an additional aspect of the feudal responsibilities of the population of each Zupa (district), who were also responsible for guarding their own frontier. The holders of both bashtinas and pronijas constituted the nobility (though many of the former were only upper-class peasants), and these were the principal native element of every Serbian army, serving as heavy cavalry (the proniiars) and infantry (the voynici), In fact most armies included only the nobility (the vlastelini, or 'holders of power') and their retinues, maintained at their own expense, but in times of emergency the arriere-ban, called the Zamanitchka Voyska ('All Together'), would be summoned. As elsewhere, this comprised all the nobility and every able-bodied freeman.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Lombards or Langobards were a Germanic tribe who ruled Italy from 568 to 774. The Lombard historian Paul the Deacon wrote in the Historia Langobardorum that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili who dwelt in southern Scandinavia[2] (Scadanan) before migrating to seek new lands. In the 1st century AD, they formed part of the Suebi, in northwestern Germany. By the end of the 5th century, they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria north of the Danube river, where they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552; his successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids at the Battle of Asfeld in 567.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War (535-554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom there. The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians, and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in central and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in Italy, later named Regnum Italicum ("Kingdom of Italy"), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler Liutprand. In 774, the Kingdom was conquered by the Frankish King Charlemagne and integrated into his Empire. However, Lombard nobles continued to rule parts of the Italian peninsula well into the 11th century when they were conquered by the Normans and added to their County of Sicily. Their legacy is apparent in the regional name, Lombardy.</English>

The Crimean Khanate was a Turkic-speaking Muslim state which was among the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the beginning of the 18th century. The nobles and rulers of the Crimean Tatars were the progeny of Haci I Girai a Jochid descendant of Genghis Khan who was Great Mongol ruler, and thus of Batu Khan of the Mongol Golden Horde. The Crimean Tatars mostly adopted Islam in the 14th century and thereafter Crimea became one of the centers of Islamic civilization. The Russo-Turkish War (1768-74) resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate.
