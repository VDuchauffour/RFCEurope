Welcome to Rhye's and Fall of Europe, a mod based on the incredibly popular original Rhye's and Fall of Civilizations (RFC).
If you've played RFC before, all the familiar elements are here: stability, plagues, dynamic rises, barbarian uprisings, Unique Powers, Unique Historical Victories,
and uniquely customized parameters designed to simulate history while allowing you the freedom to change it.
In order to simulate a time period (500 - 1800 AD) and region in greater depth we've created a new huge map of Europe with new resources and new terrain.
We've also added new civilizations, a new tech tree, new units, new civics, new corporations, new buildings and wonders.
Religion, so critical in this period, has been made much more important. Faith points, a new concept, provide unique benefits for each religion based on how pious your civilization is. 

The mod is now in beta testing. We are looking for feedback on the gameplay experience and the level of difficulty of the Unique Historical Victories.
Please post your thoughts in our forum at http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=386

You can find more details in the Manual and Reference folders in the mod. A copy of the manual is also available at http://rfceurope.sourceforge.net/


TODO:
(3M, MV1, AR - you can put this in the beginning of the line if you are working on that)

MV1		General XML updates, removing unused XML parts

	Get a speedup the hack on the semi-random bugfix from Beta 4 (look below)

	Changed Norce UHV to not count Independent cities
	Reduced the Cuman barbarians near Hungary, two lancers can easily take a city guarded even by two archers
	Add protestant missionary to the Dutch start (guarantess they are Protestant and helps them with the Faith Points)
	Redone identation of the UHV code, Python is very sensitive towards identations, should probably do it again

  Many early techs with too many benefits saw things shuffled around slightly.

  Replaced indy Koenigsberg with Tvanksta, and added some barbs (Longobards) in Northern Italy.

Changes for Alpha 6:

Various Code optimizations to speed up the game
UHVs are now readable under the victory info screen (almost entirely)
Changed the names of Byzantium and Hungary to Romaii and Magyars
Spanish spaw date moved to 912 (+1 turn), there were too many natoins (Hungary, Kiev and Spain) spawning too close to each other (more work is needed on this bug)

Some nations have high probability to start at war from spawn (i.e. Spain - Cordoba, Byzantium - Bulgaria)
Slowed down the tech rate as Myri suggested, which nerfed Kiev reasonably

Taking over leadership for the Crusade and aiming it to Jerusalem, no longer wrongfully targets Burgundy
The AI is less likely to change religions as it is aware of the loss of Faith Points
Jewish Quartes give +1 Culture (we all know the Jews + Money jokes, but Jews contributed more than just trade and commerce to Mediaeval Europe)

The AI doesn't go after Barbs and Indies outside its WarsMap, i.e. no more random French cities in eastern Russia
Respawning civs can no longer make peace with the Barbs (this is RFC bug actually)
Galleas now carry units + enter rival territory. Graphics should be better now. General Venecian sea units cannot enter foreign sea (i.e. removed the RFC Dutch UP form Venice)

Fixed a bug making a lot of the colonies to be "National" Projects

You no longer have to be richer than the Pope to take over a Crusade, only richer than the rest of the Catholics
Fixed a Dutch, Turkey and Sweden culture bug
Balance tweaks: workers and settlers are cheaper, Byzantines have a slightly higher unit production penalty ....
Fixed a Hungarian UHV bug (there might be more)
Added light version of the mod. For people with weak machines that cannot read the new leaderheads: in Assets\XML\Civilzations, delete the file CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml and rename to CIV4LeaderHeadInfos.xml_light so that you remove the _light


Old changes for Alpha 3:

The Pope no longer declares war if 2/3 victories have been won (other players still do)
The Pope does not longer attack the independents
New Leaderhead for Hungary
Map change: moved one of the fish resources to fall in Alexandria's BFC (Alexandria was at a very bad location)
Map change: some small changes on the Balkans, hopefully Simeon will now found Turnovo instead of Krayola and also get Iron

Spain now starts with no buildings (to compensate for the earlier start)
Moscow starts with Granary, Barracks, Herbalist, Forge and Market (to compensate for the late start)
Moscow starts with 4 workers

Decreased everyone's tech rate by 10%, this makes the game more interesting
Decreased Crossbowman's city defence bonus to +25%
AI is now aware of the incoming starting workers

  - Kiev spelling changes as suggested   
  - Added the Great Schism: Orthodox and Catholic players treat each other as "brothers in faith" until 1054AD   
  - Fixed the independent constant war bug, now all independents go to peace after some time   
  - Fixed a AI vs Independents war bug, used to be the AI wouldn't go to war against some independents   
  - Now Crusaders get siege Weapons as well (Jerusalem cannot fall otherwise)   
  - The first Catholic nation that captures Jerusalem gets the 8 tiles adjacent to it, i.e. establishes a small Crusader state and is not immediately devoured by the Arabic culture   
  - Try to make Crusader spawn not across the river from Jerusalem (less defensive bonuses for the city)   
  - Religion cannot be purged out of its holy city   
  - Religious prosecutions are not possible in Jerusalem   
  - Jerusalem and the various Holy Cities cannot be razed   
  - Fixed a bug making the AI agree on Defensive Pacts very easily   
  - Defensive Pacts between players of different religions is much less likely

  - Independent culture in cities dissolves with time, no more "... join motherland ..." 200 turns after you have conquered an indy city   
  - Fixed a bug that made sometimes Mongols in the middle of marshes (where they can get nowhere and no one can get to them)   
  - Bulgar/Kazan and Samara are no longer in the Moscowan spawn areas (Moscow now flip 4 as opposed to 6 cities)   
  - The Moscow UP now covers maintenance for the civics as well the cities themselves

  - All colonies now require Atlantic Access (except for the two trading companies)   
  - All colonies but two require one TC or another (as per Jessiecat's idea)

  - Minor map update on the Balkans (the Balkan mountain can now be crossed on several locations)   
  - The Pope can now build unlimited Missionaries and Prosecutors   
  - Tweaked the Pope's AI to go for the construction of more Missionaries and Prosecutors   
  - The Pope now sends his Prosecutors to other catholic nations and gifts them (needs to be tested)   
  - Updated the AI personalities of all leaders to better match their UHVs and situations   
  - Techs in the Tech tree have better tags for the AI (i.e. the benefits are correctly recognized as military vs gold vs culture)   
  - Updated visible areas upon spawn (not everything discussed is in, but being able to see land very far away will have no effect on the gameplay)   
  - Updated contacts on spawn (Byzantines now know the Pope, Kiev doesn't have to wait to meet Bulgaria and Byzantium and so on)   
  - New Leaderhead graphics for: Burgundy, Bulgaria, Norse, Kiev, Poland, Swedan and the Pope (still need Hungary, Cordoba, Genoa and Austria)   
  - Updated city name map from micbic   
  - Included the Russian Addon (I hope properly). There are only a few tags missing (3 + 1 that needs clarification), I have neither the Russian skill nor the tools to translate anything into the numerical values for Cyrillic, sorry!   
  - If you select to load the mod from the regular Civ Menu, you should immediately be taken to the Civ selection screen   
  - Iberian WB map update as Michael Vick requested, I hope I got it right

  - Starting year, loading time and UHV/UP information now fully exported to XML, should be easier to update   
  - Updated the Spanish starting year info

  - The Pope starts with Catholicism as State Religion   
  - The Byzantines start with Orthodoxy (their stability is bad without the extra anarchy)   
  - Projects generate points just like World Wonders   
  - The first Catholic player who manages to obtain control over Jerusalem will enter a golden age
