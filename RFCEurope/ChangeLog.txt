Welcome to Rhye's and Fall of Europe, a mod based on the incredibly popular original Rhye's and Fall of Civilizations (RFC).
If you've played RFC before, all the familiar elements are here: stability, plagues, dynamic rises, barbarian uprisings, Unique Powers, Unique Historical Victories,
and uniquely customized parameters designed to simulate history while allowing you the freedom to change it.
In order to simulate a time period (500 - 1800 AD) and region in greater depth we've created a new huge map of Europe with new resources and new terrain.
We've also added new civilizations, a new tech tree, new units, new civics, new corporations, new buildings and wonders.
Religion, so critical in this period, has been made much more important. Faith points, a new concept, provide unique benefits for each religion based on how pious your civilization is.

The mod is still in development. We are looking for feedback on the gameplay experience and the level of difficulty of the Unique Historical Victories.
Please post your thoughts in our forum at http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=386

You can find more details in the Manual and Reference folders in the mod. A copy of the manual is also available at http://rfceurope.sourceforge.net/

Changes for RFCE 1.4:
(under development)

	Reformation updates:
		- Strengthened the Reformation procedure, most conversion-related chances are somewhat increased
		- Revised all civs' willingness for Reformation, which now not only affects the main decision, but almost everything connected to it
		- Neither all your cities nor all the religious buildings will convert automatically, even if you embrace the Reformation (but still a significant number of them)
		- Protestantism will still spread to some of your cities, even if you decide to stay Catholic (but it won't convert any buildings)
		- Bigger number of neutral (non-Catholic majors civs, indies, barbs) nations' Catholic cities will follow the Protestant ways
		- More populous cities have increased chance to get/keep both Protestant and Catholic religions
		- Added the same minimum interval timer for converting your State Religion if you embrace the Reformation
		- Somewhat increased faith point bonuses from the Reformation (both on religion spread and on building conversion)
		- If Protestantism spreads to a city and all the religious buildings are converted, Catholicism itself might also disappear from the city
		- Various new interface messages for the different situations connected to the Reformation

	RiseAndFall updates:
		- Respawned civs can no longer collapse in the first 10 turns
		- If the civ is respawned, it's harder to collapse them by barbs
		- Vassals can now also instantly collapse if they lose a significant amount of their territory in a couple turns
		- Fixed issue where the human player collapsed less often then it should
		- Fixed issue where Byzantium could collapse in some rare cases even without losing Constantinople
		- Improved mechanics for all 4 different collapse types, collapses should be way more straightforward
		- Increased frequency of resurrections, decreased number of civs that can stay in a collapsed state at a given time
		- Respawned Cordoba or Aragon are not affected by stability penalties for not holding the original core area
		- Fixed inconsistencies on city flips connected to the spawn and respawn mechanics
		- Total collapse has much more chance to happen for the human player, for example: 60% with -15 stability, 100% with -35
		- Dynamic civ names refresh for the respawned civ right after the spawn is complete, not only on the beginning of the next turn
		- Revised civ-specific AI chances for rebirth when the actual respawn mechanics has started
		- Revised civ-specific AI values for all the various events connected to other civs respawning in their territory
		- Under suppress situations there is 30% chance for the AI that the full respawn does not happen, only some revolt in the corresponding cities
		- All vassal and master status updates happen initially on respawns, DCN refreshes for all affected civs
		- Increased chance for AI civs to vassalize respawned civs in their territory right on the spawn

	Secession and revolt updates:
		- No city secession in the first 15 turns after spawn, or in the first 10 turns after respawn
		- AI declares war on the new indy city right after city secession
		- City flips of the minor nation revolt mechanics also use the new city secession rules
		- One free defender unit for the new owner of the city
		- The first unit from the original owner will always defect to indies on city secession
		- All the other units have 60% chance to stay with the original civ
		- Settlers and Great People never flip to the indy civ on secession
		- City secession only results in a 25% culture loss for the original civ
		- Adjusted the potential bonus from stability with the strength on the revolt, so it will never be negative if you are stable enough
		- None of the actual chances can be negative on revolts, but they can modify the other options negatively in the background calculations
		- Updated and revised all texts connected to the minor nation revolts, most noticable in the popup
		- New interface messages for various events on the minor nation revolt mechanics
		- Rewrote all chance calculations for all minor nation revolt options, also the interactions between them:
			Do nothing: base chance calculated from the strength of the revolt, your stability, and your passive military presence in the city
			Military: base chance + significant bonuses for having many military units in the city and your military might
			Financial: base chance + bonuses from the amount of gold you spend on bribes, adjusted with your government form
			Both: base chance + military bonuses + financial bonuses
		- Effects from your actions on successfully preventing the revolt:
			Military: generates unhappiness in the city for 10 turns, the city goes into revolt for a turn
			Financial: bribing the lords away (thus preventing their independence) angers the rebel militia further, more attacking units will appear
			Both: all of the above effects
		- Improved city choosing method for city secession, based on the recent fixes in city stability calculations

	General changes:
		- Test version for the new 1200 AD scenario
		- Anarchy instability now appears right away for the human player, not with a turn delay
		- Revised swing stability calculations, now converges to 0 a little slower
		- Lowered anarchy swing instability for the AI, normal anarchy instability for everyone
		- Improved StoredData handling like SoI and DoC, credits to Edead
		- Increased the significance of war maps - both with increased values (when choosing target) in general, and with more differentiation between the levels
		- Indy and barb cities inside war maps have a much increased chance to be AI targets, and now this also heavily depends on the war map levels (so indy/barb cities in core areas will almost always be primary targets)
		- Indy and barb cities outside war maps now have some chance to be AI targets (were totally ignored previously), but it's significantly reduced compared to normal targets
		- Revised code and fixed various inconsistencies connected to the settler and war map setup
		- Removed all unnecessary values from all settler and war maps, now they only have WB values everywhere
		- Correct CNM name for new cities placed in the WB, now cities added there will get their RFCE name instead of one from the default city list
		- Since the WB file cannot handle special characters and long names perfectly, added function to rename city names on the start of the scenario
		- AI civs will more often reconsider their wars against minor civs (note that being an AI target and declaring an actual war is also handled separately)
		- AI war declaration on indies is now based on their war maps, the chance is increased with higher war map values
		- AI civs will much more frequently declare war on indies in their core area
		- Revised values connected to cultural revolts/flips of independents and barbs
		- Increased city cluster for many civs, it's possible for them to have closer cities in some situations
		- New rules and other various improvements in the AI city settling mechanics, most civs' city-placement should be more dense overally
		- Timber, Deer and Fur resources will disappear if the Woodland/Dense Forest/Palm Forest is cut down (remain on city-settling though)
		- Unworking stability bonus for your healthy cities changed to stability penalty for your unhealthy cities
		- Civ-wide health stability bonus: +k with an average k happiness in your cities
		- Changed happiness stability to +k with an average k happiness in your cities
		- Minor changes in the city stability calculations for the AI
		- Spawning independent cities can be selected from a pool of cities in an area, chance of spawning depends on historical importance
		- Instead of Palermo spawning in 100% of the games in 508AD, now there is 80% chance for Palermo, 20% for Syracuse
		- Hanseatic League HQ needs to be connected to a water area of at least 10 tiles
		- Added religion and/or state religion prerequisites to some additional wonders (mostly Islam and Catholic)
		- +1 additional instability for each foreign religion (after the 1st foreign one) in your cities
		- 1 less instability from Judaism with a Jewish Quarter in the city
		- No city gifting in the first 5 turns after spawn (avoid exploit with city gifting before the spawn flip for additional units)

	Text/GUI improvements:
		- New GlobalDefines_Alt.xml file, users can change RFCE-specific settings there (RFCEurope\Assets\XML\)
		- Included option in the GlobalDefines_Alt to enable/disable AI UHV checks, they are enabled by default
		- Added option to enable/disable autosaves during AI autoplay, also in the GlobalDefines_Alt (disabled by default)
		- Added new hover-function: holding down alt when hovering on the map will display the respawn areas
		- Option to enable/disable both the spawn and respawn hover displays, in the GlobalDefines_Alt (enabled by default)
		- Colour for respawn areas is purple, colour for spawn areas changed to white (for now)
		- Added some new and improved some old event and interface messages connected to Crusades and to religious persecution
		- Revised all older hints (which can be seen on loading a game) to be in sync with the latest version of the mod
		- Added around 10 new hints - some are only for fun though :)
		- Religion Screen and Company Screen can now handle long names with unicode characters
		- Improved religion foundation date information on the Religion Screen, also it now takes different scenarios into account
		- Improved city and wonder foundation date/city/civ information on the Info Screen, also it now takes different scenarios into account
		- Fixed mistakes on the Info Screen where information from the top5 cities and from the wonders were not in sync (connected to city visibility and contact with the civ)
		- Readded era displays to various screens (main, info, religion) before the discovery of Calendar
		- Colour changes in various interface messages
		- Minor updates in the non-CNM city names
		- Updated the Stability Guide in the Civilopedia with all the recent changes
		- In the 1200AD scenario the 500AD DoM texts were set for all civs spawning later than 1200AD
		- Added Venetian, Byzantine, Arab and English DoM texts for the 1200 AD scenario - by TheMulattoMaker and DC123456789
		- New help text for Jewish Quarter, other minor text updates in the Civilopedia
		- Fixed potential display issue on the Info Screen with the initial selection of the graphs screen pull-down menu

	Balance/setup:
		- Sweden starts with the following civics: Feudal Monarchy, Serfdom, Manoralism
		- Cordoban UP update: +1 food bonus for every 2 excess health, but applied in all cases (not only when the city is not starving without the bonus from health)
		- For the 1st Cordoban UHV, Cordoba should be the biggest city alone (tie is not enough)
		- New Dynamic Civ Names for Burgundy, Cordoba (+ Tunisia), Morocco
		- Work boats can also pass foreign borders, as all other naval units
		- Lowered cost of Religious Prosecutors, upped their max number to 3
		- Decreased some production modifiers for Cordoba, increased for Novgorod
		- Less barbarians around Novgorod, reduced both the generic barb spawns and the Mongol threat for them
		- Successful Crusade spreads Catholicism to Jerusalem (if not present already)
		- Wattasids won't revolt if Morocco controls the region, they now appear in their DCN as a ruling dynasty
		- Reduced overall damage from the Hungarian Végvár: units won't get a fixed amount of damage, it depends on their current HP instead (so Végvár won't kill units, only weaken them)
		- Slightly decreased number of Steppe Horse Archer barbs for Kiev
		- New Sahara province, adjusted borders of North African provinces
		- Morocco starts with Literature, so they can remain in the Religious Law civic
		- Revised all barbs for Cordoba and Morocco, no more Berber barbarians in Iberia

		- Destroying work boats is reduced to only one Viking point for the Norwegian UHV (same as for pillaging settled fishing boats)
		- Increased Norwegian Viking points UHV from 80 to 100 (with the new cities in England it's still not hard at all)
		- Janissary UP: only -1 instability from foreign religion in your cities - not necessarily a historical aspect of the UP, but important for gameplay
		- Lowered Janissary threshold to 300 for the human player, 200 for the AI
		- Norwegian 2nd UHV: Scotland and Northumbria instead of Mercia
		- Franks start with the Theology tech, in the State Religion civic, and with Catholicism as their State Religion
		- Nerfed various German production and support modifiers, they seem to have much more cities with the new AI city placement rules
		- Cut back tech progression for Germany and a couple other AI civs, Protestantism was founded before 1500 in most recent games
		- Decreased Ottoman unit production and maintenance bonuses, with the recent changes they are doing better than great :)
		- Added a couple more starting units to many later starting civs (Austria, Ottomans, Dutch included)

		- Fixed 2 different issues connected to stability calculations in anarchy (resulted in extra instability in longer anarchies)
		- Fixed Religion Screen bug which was caused by the Convert and Exit buttons being the same (you actually click on both when clicking on either)
		- Fixed bug with anarchy instability if you switch civics/religion on popup, not on the screens
		- Fixed a couple mistakes in python code which resulted in .dll assert failures (they were probably harmless though)

		- Fixed assert failure connected to the new civic screen
		- Fixed possible CTD with some AI worker action calculations, based on a Firaxis mistake - by OrionVeteran

			- Bulgaria starts without missionaries or Orthodoxy as a State Religion

		- Detailed info for UHV progress for all civs, in the Victory Screen (F8)
		- Removed some redundant info from the UHV texts (details are in the victory screen)
		- New UHV help for the 1st Polish UHV
		- All UHV colony checks are handled on project built (instead of every turn), should make checks much faster (except for the Spanish UHV, which is only checked on a given turn)
		- Trading companies don't count as colonies for the UHV anymore
		- Revised Colony UHVs:
			- France: Empire of the World: Build 5 Colonies
			- Spain: The Spanish Armada: Have more Colonies than any other nation in 1588AD (while having at least 3)
			- Venice: Domination of the World Ocean: Be the first to build a modern Colony (so Vinland doesn't count)
			- England: Jewel of the Crown: Build 7 Colonies
			- Portugal: Feitorias all over the world: Build 5 Colonies
			- Dutch: The India Companies: Build 3 Colonies and complete both Trading Companies
			- Every UHV should trigger right on the completion of the last project/colony
		- Changed Atlantic Access to appear earlier near Scandinavia, in 1580 - needed for the Danish UHV
		- North Atlantic Access near Vinland disappears in the exact date of Norway's second UHV
		- Disabled UHV checks for the AI (faster turn times)
		- Updated Hungarian territory UHV check, now it's province based and totally accurate
		- Kiev needs 25000 food for the 3rd UHV, but their 2nd UHV also has Moscow province

	Indies and barbs:
		- Added reduce city mechanics (to towns for example) on a given turn or event - could be useful for many UHVs
		- Indy city in Svealand province: Uppsala, spawns in 800AD
		- Indy city in East Anglia province: Norwich, spawns in 640AD
		- Indy city in Mercia province: Nottingham, spawns in 867AD
		- York (Eboracum) starts in 500AD
		- Uppsala reduced to town on the Swedish spawn, Norwich and Nottingham on the English spawn
		- Revised barb spawns:
			- Further separated barbs for the human and the AI
			- AI civs won't get extra barbarians on harder levels. Also somewhat less extra barbs for the human player on harder levels
			- Slightly tuned down general number of barbs for Byzantium, France, Cordoba
			- 3 new unit types: Bedouin, Turcoman Horse Archer, Steppe Horse Archer
			- More variety in the Seljuk units (4 new units, all unique to the Seljuks, most are somewhat more powerful than their regular counterparts)
			- Lowered Seljuk Lancer's (RFCE's "original" Seljuks) strength from 13 to 11, but Seljuks are still harder to counter because of the new unit types
			- Livonian Order as barbs (Sword Brethen) in the area before the Prussian spawn
			- Pre-Lithanian barbs (Baltic Heathens) for human Prussia a couple turns before the Lithuanian spawn
			- Banu Hilal and Bani Hassan barbs in Morocco and Tunesia (Bedouins)

			- Barbarian Anglo Saxons spawning in Wessex and Mercia to represent the resistance to Danish rule
			- Barbarian Scottish Highlanders only spawn when Scotland is dead

			- Revised some areas of the Mongol spawn zone, for example no Keshiks directly for Novgorod
			- Less barbs in the Maghreb, in Arabia, and near Kiev
		- New independent city: Londinium. Starts in 500 AD, size 2, 2 archers, catholic religion, prebuilt walls
		- New independent city: Caen. Starts in 912 AD (establishment of the Duchy of Normandy), size 1, 2 crossbowman, catholic religion
		- Catalonia province won't revolt against Aragon, Scotland province won't revolt against Scotland
		- The city of Novgorod no longer spawn a couple turns before the Novgorodian start, no preplaced Marrakesh either
		- Reduced chance of cultural flips for barbarian cities - especially important in Anatolia for the former Byzantine cities
		- Reduced raze city probability for the AI, bigger reduction for the barbarians, small for the rest

	Stability:
		- Minor changes in the collapse mechanics - should be somewhat more common for the AI to collapse, if they lose a significant part of their territory
		- City secession has much bigger chance to occur for all civs
		- Losing your capital results in a much bigger stability hit (20 for Byzantium, 5 for Scotland, 10 for everyone else)
		- Losing a city in your core or historical territory also means a bigger stability hit
		- Revised initial stability for the different difficulty levels
		- Rewrote most triggers for stability collapses and revolts:
			- In huge empires, if stability is bad, there is 80% for the secession/city revolt mechanics to start, and only 10% for the collapse mechanics
			- In medium empires, 40% for the secession/city revolt mechanics, 40% for the collapse mechanics
			- In small empires, 70% chance for collapse mechanics, no chance for secession/city revolt mechanics
			- Actual chance for triggering a revolt or collapse inside those mechanics is scaling with stability
			- Note that bad stability is not the only way to trigger collapses or revolts
		- Having a city in a foreign province means -5 stability, in a border/contested province -2 stability
		- Small boost to Merchant Republic and Bureaucracy stability, but both can be way more unstable than before with too many cities
		- Imperialism civic and the French UP works without a hard cap on number of cities
		- Fixed inconsistencies in the city stability calculations - way more deadly for the human player if the cities are managed poorly
		- The AI has less severe stability penalties for not maintaining it's cities (populace) well enough
		- Updated the stability guide. Civilopedia/Concepts/Stability Guide
		- Revised stability changes and connected mechanics on religious persecution

			- Temporary instability: 3
			- Norwegian UP: -1 permanent stability loss and no temporary instability for razing cities
		- Reduced permanent stability loss from anarchies
		- Stability always updates when entering the stability/finances (F2) screen
		- Minor improvements in the stability code, fixing various python exceptions
		- Fixed bug in the stability handicap levels (+2 base stability on monarch)
		- Tuned down unintentionally harsh stability penalties connected to war weariness (4-7 stab difference for medium sized-empires, also it appears later in the war)
		- Increased culture instability in newly conquered cities (less than 20% own culture)
		- Small stability boost on completed UHVs (currently +3/UHV)
		- Vassalage is stable with Feudal Law, Common Law is unstable with Serfdom, Imperialism is unstable with Merchant Republic

	Persecution updates:
		- Loot is significantly increased when you successfully purge a religion
		- -3 swing instability on successful persecution (0 for Spain)
		- Unhappiness because of persecution ("We cannot forget your cruel oppression") only appears in the city on successful persecution
		- Persecution counter/timer reintroduced, with a new approach:
			- Nationwide variable, goes down by 1 each turn
			- New counter for it on the main screen (Persecution, only shown if >0, right below the faith point counter)
			- +8 to the counter on successful persecution (4 for Spain), 4 on unsuccessful (2 for Spain)
			- Causes religious instability, 1 with 1-3, 2 with 4-6, 3 with 7-9, etc.
			- The timer (Persecution Instability Cooldown), and the caused instability (Persecution Instability) are also shown in the Religion Screen (F7)
		- Even with the increased instability from religious prosecution, still way better to persecute than to leave untolerated religions in your cities

	Crusades:
		- Increased number of units leaving the civs for a crusade, but it's low on the first 10-20 turns after a civ is born
		- Also, more crusader units will go home (leave your army)
		- Some of the units will return from all Crusades after a couple turns, not only if Jerusalem is conquered
		- No more free Templars/Teutons/Paladins/Knights for the base crusader army if the crusading civ doesn't know Chivalry yet (Lancers and Heavy Lancers instead)
		- No longer possible for your GG units to leave you for a crusade (as normal units)
		- Slightly reduced number of units for Defensive Crusades
		- Separated unit randomizing method for Defensive Crusades (so no more all Paladin DCs), also reduced chance for Paladins

		- Boost for Workshops and Lumbermills - were total worthless before, now they are somewhat on pair with Windmills and Watermills
			- Apprenticeship civic gives +1 production for Lumbermills too
			- Steam Engine tech gives +1 production for Lumbermills too
			- Workshops have +1 base production (so now -1 food, +2 production)
			- English UP changed to +1 production and +1 commerce for Workshops (was +2 production before)
		- Mercantilism civic gives +1 commerce for Villages too
		- Updated Great Person lists
		- Updated the RFCE Timeline
		- Resource rearrengement near Prussia, Lithuania, Poland, Novgorod (mainly iron and horse)
		- Sulphur for Prussia is now in Brandenburg - UU is tied to Kingdom of Prussia, not to Teutonic Order

		- Bigger city attack penalty for most mounted units: -25% for most light cavalry, -20% for most heavy cavalry, -10% for most unique and special mounted units
		- Slightly tuned down Hungarian and Venetian tech progress (both player and AI)
		- Increased various maintenance modifiers for Byzantium (especially for the AI), decreased for Burgundy (was still set to the 500AD start)
		- Changed sea spawns: naval starting units can spawn inside other players' sea territory, as all naval units can enter foreign borders anyway
		- Kiev moved to 882 AD (text only though, so no changes in the gameturn)
		- Extra aspect for the Cordoban UP: excess health contributes to city growth, but only if it's not starving without the food bonus from health (idea from DoC) - perfect for the 1st UHV
		- Less resistance on city conquest: multiple things affecting it, but usually around 1 turn with 1-2 population, 2 turns with 3-5, 3 with 6-9, 4 with 10-14, 5 with 15+

Changes for RFCE 1.2:
(no release, SVN only)

	Stability improvements:
		- Province stability levels:
			- Core: Your core area; very stable, but huge stability penalty if someone else has a city there
			- Natural: Your historically stable area; stability bonus for cities there, but also small penalty if it's not yours
			- Potential: Your potentially stable area; becomes a Natural province when you settle or conquer a city there, but no penalties until this happens
			- Border: Outer or contested area; small initial stability penalty for expanding there
			- Foreign: Unstable area; large stability penalty and revolt risk for having cities there
			- Removed Desired province type altogether
		- Stability Overlay:
			- Color code for the provinces: Cyan for Core, Green for Natural, Yellow for Potential, Orange for Border, Red for Foreign
			- The overlay may be toggled with it's button above the minimap, or with the Ctrl+K key combination
			- It shows all province tiles color-coded on the map, including mainland water tiles (fresh and salt water lakes)
			- When the overlay is up, there is a civ choosing table above the overlay button, so you can check province stability level for all civs, not just for yourself!!
			- The overlay dynamically refreshes when a province's stability is changed for any of the civs
			- Province border functions (ctrl + hover on the map) moved to python from the dll, easier to costumize this way
			- Province borders got the same color code as they have in the stability overlay (but obviously it always shows the stability level of the civ you play with)
			- Provinces are only colored and showed inside your visible area (both in the overlay and with ctrl + hovering) intentionally, so they may show up partly
		- Tweaked the existing secession mechanics:
			- Instead of total collapses, there is way more chance for a single city to declare independence
			- Only one city can revolt in a turn, if it happens, there is no chance for collapse for the given civ
			- May happen even with -1 stability, the chance for it starts very low, but exponentially increasing with lower stability
			- Chance that one of your cities will declare independence is around 2% with -1 stability, around 25% with -6 stability, around 80% with -12 stability
			- If a city does declare it's independence, one of your cities will be randomly chosen (any city can be chosen if it's not close to your capital)
			- Cities in Natural or Core provinces may only be chosen if happiness or health is too low, or with some specific anger modifiers (religion, no military presence, etc)
			- Cities in Border provinces have 4x chance, cities in Foreign provinces have 9x chance to be chosen, than your cities in more stable areas
		- Increased stability penalty for having cities in Foreign provinces
		- Revised all civs' initial province stabilty levels, and all the dynamic province stability level changes. Some highlights:
			- Expanded and/or increased almost all civs' province stability to some extent, especially for Byzantium, the Ottomans and Kiev
			- Byzantium keeps many of their previously important provinces as Border provinces (including southern Italy and the African coastline), for the human player
			- Both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Islands (Azores, Madeira, Canaries, Balears, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, Crete, Rhodes, Cyprus) are better for many civs
			- A couple more dynamic stability level changes, especially around the new provinces, in Central Europe and the Balkans, and for Byzantium
			- France and Burgundy almost totally complete each other with their potential provinces

	General changes:
		- Spawn of Arabia moved back one turn (632AD), Ottoman spawn one turn earlier (1356AD)
		- Venetian and Genoan spawn moved one turn later (it's better for their historical spawn dates of 810AD and 1016AD)
		- Fixed starting date for Spain - 910AD, Germany - 856AD (though both start in the same turn as before)
		- Interface message when a resource appears/disappears within your cultural borders
		- Interface message when wonders are destroyed/captured by you, by a known civilization, or from a known civilization
		- Interface message for the preset religion spreads (same way as it is when religions spread "normally")
		- Judaism got an additional random spread mechanics, with bigger chance for spreading in central european cities
		- Dead civs won't show up on the scoreboard anymore
		- Autoraze changes: if the city has 1 population, 60% chance to autoraze if culture is less than 10, 30% chance to autoraze if culture is at least 10 but less than 50
		- All naval units can cross cultural borders during peace (without open borders), except work boats (to avoid exploration with work boats)
		- Diagonal water tiles are passable for all naval units. The most important straits are represented this way on the map
		- Removed 3Miro's AI regions, seriously hurt AI civs on the border of 2 regions, also every AI civ's units with somewhat automated functions (barbs, workers, missionaries, GPs, etc.)
		- Ottomans spawn in Gallipoli (Dardanelles), so they have a connection between Europe/Anatolia. No second spawn stack needed, and Adrianople/Edirne doesn't flip to them
		- Edirne becomes the Ottoman Capital if they conquer it before Constantinople, Constantinople becomes the Ottoman Capital whenever they conquer it (without stability hit)
		- The Wattasid revolt moved to Fez province, so now Tanja in the Tetouan province (city on the African part of Gibraltar, with AA) is relatively safe
		- Added compatibility for the Latin-1 set for provinces, so we can have all Latin-1 characters in the province names
		- Minimal wait between revolutions is increased to 10 turns - both for civic and religion changes
		- Culture modifiers per province type: all civs get 1/3 culture in unstable, 2x in solid, and 3x in core provinces
		- Introduction of a new, generic city name map, which will be the base for all the other ones
		- Adjusted visibility map for Poland, Hungary, England, Germany, Burgundy, Genoa and Spain
		- Lowered the happiness modifiers (base happiness in your cities) for all difficulty levels: 4 for Viceroy, 3 for Monarch, 2 for Emperor
		- Various small tweaks in many balance aspects of the different difficulty levels (mostly for Viceroy and Emperor). Research, inflation, AI costs, etc.
		- Greatly reduced the barbarian number difference between Monarch and Emperor, and between Monarch and Viceroy
		- Switched bonus of Westminster Abbey (now enables all Religion Civics) and Golden Bull (now enables all Labor Civics)
		- Restored Pinch promotion

	Map and province changes:
		- Huge changes in the SE region: Egypt, Levant and Anatolia totally revised
		- Smaller changes in the northern coast of the Black Sea, and in the south Balkans
		- Revised rivers in Hungary (Danube, Drava, Szava, Koros) and south Poland (added river San), small terrain changes in the borders of the Carpathian-basin
		- Removed the "lakes" (scattered coastline) from Dalmatia, it was strange with the new strait mechanics. Lake Scutari remains on the coast though
		- Damascus is finally moved to a geographically more correct place (3S), obviously the Arabian spawn moved here
		- The new map resulted in moving Jerusalem (1SW) and Constantinople (1S) too, along with almost all the preplaced Byzantine cities
		- Changes in the preplaced Byzantine cities: Amastris instead of Nicaea (too close to Constantinople), Edessa instead of Aleppo (too close to Antioch)
		- The most important remaining Byzantine cities (not preplaced in 500AD) are represented by towns: Nicomedia, Nicaea, Ephesus, Abydos, Ancyra, Attaleia, Aleppo, Trapezus
		- New indy city Ras instead of Belgrad, spawns in 768 with the Serbian Principality (Rascia). Rhodes spawns as indy in 600 AD (Nomos Rhodion Nautikos)
		- Egyptian city sites revised as well - realistic place for Alexandria, Cairo and Damietta, with better terrain and resource placement
		- Balancing early food production near Constantinople, Alexandria and the Cordoban starting area - to be possible to make Cordoba the largest city for their 1st UHV
		- Now that culture is passable on the sea, Orkney is back on the map
		- Added the Dardanelles strait to the map, so the Ottoman spawn doesn't have to be separated into an Anatolian and European part
		- Added the Oresund strait to the map - connecting Denmark and Norway will seriously strengthen the Norse AI
		- New indy cities: Seville (spawns in 500AD as Hispalis, flips to Cordoba), Fez (780 AD), Beloozero (800 AD), Tanais (1392 AD, Timurid conquest)
		- New indy cities: Graz (spawns in 1110AD, flips to Austria), Kalmar (spawns in 1050AD, flips to Sweden), Vologda is removed for now
		- Added salt lakes (mesosaline and hypersaline) to the mod: Dead Sea near Jerusalem, Lake Tuz in Anatolia - same yield as coast
		- Red Sea (the visible parts in RFCE) and Sea of Marmara are now coastal ocean tiles, instead of being fresh water lakes due to their small size
		- The eastern part of the Black Sea got a line of coast tiles, the actual coast is only 1-2 tiles away anyway, and this way early ships can pass there too
		- New provinces: Banat (representing the southern Banates of medieval Hungary), Holstein (buffer province between Denmark and Germany, also helps in the French first UHV)
		- New provinces: Prussia (for the Teutonic Order/Prussia civ), Liguria (better to have a separate province because of the French UHV)
		- Lots of small province adjustments: primarly near the new provinces, in the Austrian territories, in Scandinavia, and in the Polish-Lithuanian-Kievan territories
		- Province Croatia merged into Slavonia, province adjustment in the area - the Dalmatian coast will be better shaped (culturally between Venice and Hungary or Austria)
		- Both Alba Iulia / Gyulafehervar and Lubeck spawns 1 tile north, to follow the province changes
		- Small resource rearrangement in Greece/Southern Balkans, and in the Levant/Arabia

	Balance:
		- Moved spawn area of Germanic Barbarians west, now some of them will actually attack France instead of wandering in Germany
		- Minor tweaks to the French and Cordoban barb spawns, further separating it for the human and the AI player, less barbs for AI Arabia
		- Lowered barbarian activity in the North African area (now that barbs can attack targets farther away it could be overpowered on the African coastline)
		- Slightly lowered the base duration of the occupation resistance
		- Removed free wins against barbarians - this means some of the early barbs might have to be rebalanced
		- Increased the maximum XP you can get from barbarians (not from a single battle, the total XP) - was 10, now there is no cap
		- Lowered preset diplomacy modifiers, overkill to have 10+ relations there
		- Now that free wins are removed, early barbs for Byzantium are somewhat reduced for the human player
		- Plague of Constantinople will hit Byzantium earlier than before (late 6th century), thus it won't hit on the very same turns as the Arab spawn

Changes for RFCE 1.1:
(released: 2012.10.24.)

	Major changes:
		- Inquisition overhaul:
			- All persecutions can remove maximum one religion
			- Chooseable religion for the human player, with a popup on persecution if there are more than one possible target religions
			- The AI will choose it's target religion based on a preset order of the religions:
				- Catholicism as state religion: Islam, Protestantism, Judaism, Orthodoxy
				- Orhodoxy as state religion: Islam, Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism
				- Protestantism as state religion: Catholicism, Islam, Orthodoxy, Judaism
				- Islam as state religion: Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Protestantism, Judaism
				- Judaism as state religion: Islam, Protestantism, Orthodoxy, Catholicism
			- Tolerance factor for the AI: how tolerant are the different civs towards non-state religions:
				- The most tolerant civs won't purge any religions
				- Some will only purge Islam if they have a Chistian State Religion, or purge the Christian religions if they have Islam as state religion
				- Some civs will also purge Judaism (on top of the previous category)
				- Some civs will purge everything other than their State Religion (so even the other 2 Christian religions if they are Christian)
			- Holy cities cannot be persecuted from their holy religion
			- Your state religion cannot be persecuted, and you can only persecute if you have a state religion
			- Persecution has a base chance to succeed between 50% and 90%, based on your civ's faith
			- The base chance is modified in the following cases:
				- Religious buildings of the target religion (in the target city) slightly lower this chance
				- Religious wonders of the target religion (in the target city) seriously lower this chance
				- Jerusalem has a lower base chance on default
			- If persecution succeeds, all religious buildings are destroyed (including religious wonders - this will fix the inconsistency with the Spanish UHV)
			- The AI won't purge religions in cities where there is a wonder tied to that religion
			- Small revolt and unhappiness after both successful and unsuccessful persecution
			- Short term stability loss (Swing Stability) after successful persecution
			- Some of the population is killed/expelled if persecution succeeds
			- Gold loot from the killed/expelled population and from the destroyed buildings
			- Successful persecution increases your faith by one
			- Interface message for the successful/unsuccessful persecution
			- If Judaism is persecuted, it has 80% chance to move to another city on the map, also with interface message
			- Diplomatic penalty with civs who has the persecuted religion as their state religion
			- Lowered the cost of persecutor units
		- Language changes:
			- As of revision 993, the russian version is a separate download. An add-on to the mod
			- The main reason behind this is the need of the original special characters of Civ IV (Latin-1 character set instead of a russian one)
			- This will enable us to use such characters: âáäéëíöüúó... (actually we could use them before, but only in the civilopedia)
			- Now we can have civ-specific names everywhere, including everything that appear on the map
			- Specifically: UUs, UBs, civ specific Great People names, and most importantly: city names
			- Added special characters to some of the hungarian and german city names as a test
			- Instead of Russian, Portuguese is being added as the 6th language, as it uses the same gamefont set as the other main languages
			- Caliom's WB tool updated, so it can handle all special chars from the Latin-1 set
		- Interface:
			- Demographics Screen:
				- Tweaks to the demographics screen. Urban Population, Military Power, Land Area, etc.
				- New statistics on the demographics screen: Total Population, Soldiers
				- Urban Population is the summary of the population in your cities
				- Total Population = Urban population * era multiplier + 4000 * unit number + constant
				- Era multiplier based on turn number (slowly decreasing from 7 to 4)
				- The result for Total Population is rounded to 5000
				- Soldiers show the actual number of military units (one unit represents about 3000 soldiers)
				- Military Power is an index for total power (so both actual and potential power included)
				- Land Area also shows a more realistic number (around 2.200-2.300 km2 per tile)
			- UHV counters:
				- Lithuania got an interface counter for it's culture UHV
				- Improved UHV counter for the Polish 3rd UHV
				- All UHV counters are removed on the 1st turn after the UHV date
				- So you can still check how far would have you gone, even if you complete it earlier
				- If there is no exact UHV date, they are removed upon UHV completion
			- New mercenary message if the merc is available in a province where your culture do not allow you to hire it
			- Settler/war maps and spawn/respawn areas are shown on the minimap when editing them in the WB
			- New interface icons (on the main map) for great general points and stability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Beta 14 (Release Candidate):
(released: 2012.01.08.)

	General changes and UHV updates:
		- Add a stability guide in the civilopedia (Beware, the guide is outdated at some points)
		- Vinland is buildable until 1250 (but the UHV is unchanged), adds 1 Timber and 1 Wine for now
		- Lowered both Cordoban leaders chance for capitulation (now they should be extremely hard to capitulate)
		- Colony screen always shows all the civs
		- Adjusted "home flags" on the colony screen
		- Swedish Tennant is now a Night Watch replacement (what's the fun in a UB if it's preplaced in all your cities so you can never build it?) - from RFCE++
		- By the same logic, Aqueduct (Hammam) is no longer a preplaced building for the Ottomans. They have reduced cost though
		- Temple Mount (preplaced in Jerusalem) adds a Relic resource
		- Arabian UHV requires 35% islam instead of 25%
		- When the Jews are prosecuted from one city, then automatically move to another city from a player that is most tolerant (measured by civics and lack of prosecutions)
				This means that you will not be able to completely remove the Jews from the map (and leave only Jerusalem), but that at best you can get the Jews out of your land
				Also, there should be a lot more Jews left in late game
		- All UHVs, AI and mercenary regions, defensive crusades are updated to the new map and provinces
		- Many barbarian spawns got separated: they should be hard on the human player, but much easier if the civ is played by the AI
		- Removed Kharkov, Samara and Bulgar as indy cities. New indy spawns: Kursk in 800 AD, Nizhny Novgorod in 1320 AD. Smolensk now spawns earlier, in 960 AD
		- Cordoban and Kievan province stability updated
		- Added Shrine of Uppsala code: +1 culture for all your cities if you don't have a state religion
		- Added Pagan Shrine code so the Culture bonus goes with No State Religon only and the Shrine is now obsolete with Divine Right.
		- Shrine of Uppsala happiness bonus reduced (now that the new bonus is in place), but it gives 2 Great Prophet/Theologian points
		- Viking 2nd UHV now needs Northumbria not Mercia, so York covers it
		- Temples and the Shrine of Uppsala moved to the Religious Art tech, while the "build" culture option moved to the Literature tech
		- Increased first culture expansion (Fledging) to 20 culture. We may increase it a little more, will see for the next version
		- Added Palm Forest feature as light forest, mostly for aesthatics. No extra yields for the tile, stays when improved (so no chopping), 10% defence for units
		- Updates and fixes to some terrain, feature and improvement dependencies:
				All tiles which produce at least one food are settleable
				Now you can build cottages on flood plains, workshops on moorlands as it was intended.
				Cottages are only buildable where the base tile (sum of terrain and elevation) produces at least one food
				Increased chopping bonus from dense forest
				May have to set dummy chopping values for Palm Forest with a few improvements - it's possible that it doesn't look good with all of them
		- You can now Shift + Hover over the map and see the Spawn zones for each player. Just hover around the area where they will spawn.
		- Added Caliom's World Builder tool to the main version. Mostly for the modders, but also handy to check settler/war map or spawn/respawn area visualizations
		- New UHV for Kiev, now they have to hold 10 provinces out of 13 in their historically accurate region

	Mercenaries:
		- Mercs desert only if you don't have enough gold AND your Commerce slider is set to 0 (i.e. there is no way to get more money)
		- Mercs now show proper text if they leave the Merc pool and Mercs show the province where they become available (when they become available)
		- New Mercs: Doppelsoldner, Irish Brigade, Stradiot, Waardgelder, Naffatun, Turkopoles, Walloon Guard, Swiss Line Infantry, Lipka Tatars
				Highlander Infantry, Zanji Spearman (Sudan Spearman), Touareg Camel Archer, Medjay (Nubian Longbowman)
		- Swiss Pikeman available in a much bigger area, Almogavar available in Greece (Catalan Company)
		- New art for Don Cossack, Huscarl
		- Mercs should get proper promotion prerequisites now, you should no longer see Mercs with Combat III but no Combat I and II

	Huge map overhaul:
		- Totally new Iberia, North Africa, Britain, Atlantic Islands, Scandinavia
		- Major changes to France, the Austrian/Venetian/Dalmatian area, southern Bulgaria, Finland
		- Minor changes to the Mediterranean Islands, Lombardy and Tuscany, southern Hungary
		- More realistic rivers and revised resource placement in most of the mentioned areas
		- New provinces: Fez, Navarre, La Mancha, Gotland
		- Moved capital/starting location: Cordoba, Leon, Lisboa, London, Frankfurt, Wien, Preslav, Stockholm, Moscow
		- Revised all indy/barb cities spawn coordinates and spawn attributes
		- Adjusted core and normal areas to fit the recent changes
		- Updated all civs' war and settler maps
		- Added palm/light forest to the mediterranean coast

	Other map and province changes:
		- Coffee isn't preplaced, but appears around 1450 AD
		- Removed Relic resource from the map (was under Jerusalem)
		- Indy Porto renamed to Portucale
		- Moved Estonia to Estern Europe Region, otherwise Barbarians from Estonia were trying to attack the Norse in Scandinavia and they had no way to get there
		- Same as Estonia, Morocco had to be moved from the Islands Region to the North Africa Region
		- Moved Bosnia and Croatia to Central Europe Region, hopefully this will help the Venice AI
		- Norrland province is only in Sweden, Osterland expanded

Changes for Beta 13:
(released: 2011.10.16.)

	Major Changes:
		- New Mercenary scheme:
			- You cannot contract your units out (basically sell) as mercenaries anymore, mercs are only there to hire them
			- Mercs are tied to provinces, thus we can have region specific mercs. Also they appear in the given province when hired
			- Mercenaries are also tied to specific intervals on the timeline
			- Added a bunch of generic mercs, they can be updated with specific names later on
			- Added the following unique mercenaries: Condottiero, Swiss Pikeman, Almogavar, Black Guard, Varangian Guard, Huscarl, Hackapell, Reiter, Zaporozhian Cossack, Don Cossack
			- Readded Tagmata, Corsair, Welsh Longbowman, Highlander as unique mercenaries (some of these also availeable as barbs)
			- Update to Merc Mechanics: Mercs are only available at one province at a time
			- Mercs can also randomly leave the pool
			- You can only hire a merc in a province where you have at least one city with 10 culture points (culture level more than poor)
			- The player gets a message when new Mercs become available
			- If a player doesn't have enough gold to support the currently hired mercs, then some of the mercs will desert
		- Revised crusade mechanics:
			- Some of the crusader units will leave after capturing Jerusalem
			- Templars and Teutonic Knights never return, and they can be hired as mercenaries in the region, especially around Jerusalem
			- Added Jerusalem Minor Nation so that it will revolt against the Crusaders and make it hard to keep Jerusalem
			- Syria also got minor nation status, so Damascus won't be a so tempting target. The goal is to make Jerusalem the most important city in the region for the player too
			- Jerusalem is on a relic bonus (so the contoller of the city gets a relic resource)
		- Golden Age now allows for Anarchy-free change of Civics and Religion (like in regular BtS)
		- Interface:
			- New screen to display which colonies have been built.
			- The Main Screen shows the percent penalty for researching techs early or late
			- New starting theme (intro screen) is a scrolling image of the Bayeaux Tapestry
			- Since the Bayeaux Tapestry doesn't work properly yet, we replaced it with a static image of The Siege of Acre, at least for now
			- Adjusted Dawn of Man screen
			- Merc names and Barbarian names appear in the format: Horse Archer (Khazars)
		- Graphics light version:
			- In the RFCEurope\Assets\XML\Civilizations and RFCEurope\Assets\XML\Art folders, there are two files that end with .xml_light
			- If those two files replace the corresponding .xml files, then the game will use only BtS leaderhead graphics and the mod will be much lighter

		Added more starting techs to Lithuania

		Poland no longer builds Prosecutors
		Islam now spreads through North Africa

	Changed Norce UHV to not count Independent cities
	Reduced the Cuman barbarians near Hungary, two lancers can easily take a city guarded even by two archers
	Add protestant missionary to the Dutch start (guarantess they are Protestant and helps them with the Faith Points)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.03.22.:

	Art:
		New Cordoban flag
		Better version of Moscow and Bulgaria flag, symbol still a bit too complicated to work well IMHO
		New Hungarian flag
		Worst tech button art fixed.
		Slightly better Russian Kremlin art.

	Misc:
		Dense Forest now allows mines, watermills, and camps from the start (as these do not clear the dense forest). Lumbermills allowed with appropriate tech.
		Other improvements are only available after the clearing of the dense forest. You need to research Machine Tools for that (tech tree displays this funny though)
		New city name maps from micbic
		New wonders from JediClemente
		Krak des Chevaliers now works
		Restored Serfdom village growth penalty
		House of Wisdom gives +100% science (obsolete at Education). This is offset by the penalty on Arabic/Cordoban science.
		Removed Orthodoxy from Jerusalem to fix occasional problem with Arabs turning Orthodox at the beginning
		Fixed bug with many early civs getting Education at start.
		Fixed some starting techs to be in sync with progression of maritime techs.
		Rice removed from WorldBuilderSave, now spawns on the map at appropriate time (see Resources.py)
		In Iberia, the goal is that the Spanish/Portuguese AI normally takes over the peninsula. I think we will have to adjust UHVs around this fact.
		Cordoban AI now expands more into Portugal, to increase this fight
		Barbarians spawn in North Africa to provide another challenge for Cordoba around 1000 AD.

Changes for Test Version 2009.03.14.:

	Overhauled buildings. Main features:
		More religious buildings and religious buildings are important for early science (library -> scriptorium). Catholicism and Orthodoxy are equivalent, but Protestantism and Islam have somewhat different buildings. Some new art to accompany these changes, but not finished (particularly Orthodoxy).
		Removed colosseum and re-assigned or gave new UBs to the civs affected
		Resources now are more even. Each health/happy resource now has one building which produces a better product from the raw material (causes it to give +1 more happy/health) and one which sells the resource (causes it to give +% food or money).
		Some production buildings (Forge/Mason/Carpenter) now give production bonuses only with the appropriate resources.
		Market is now prerequisite for some of the buildings which sell something.
		New Arabic UB, Bazaar replacing Market (Madrassa is now a generic Islamic building)

	Map changes:
		Map changes from Jessiecat
		Modified city names from micbic
		Spanish WarMap redone to encourage killing Corodoba
		Arab WarMap redone to encourage invading Turkey
		Austria gets Prague on spawn.
		Cordoba spawn moved one square to the west.

	Misc:
		Scientist renamed scholar
		Bulgarian UHV can no longer be to build libraries. Currently set to Scriptoria in the code, but not in the description.
		More color/flag/button changes for civs.
		Dense Forest no longer allows farms, mines, etc. Only lumber-mills can be built here (eventually).
		Barbarians around Bulgaria a bit weaker
		Made Cordoba even weaker, and Spain hate them more.
		Turkey starts with a couple Islamic Missionaries.
		Trading Companies no longer count as a colony for victory.
		Guisarme made cheaper 60 -> 50
		Heavy Lancer made weaker 11 -> 10 to address imbalance
		African colonies (except South Africa) moved earlier and no longer require Trading Companies
		Road movement increases to 3 with Vaulted Arches
		Modified some spawn units a little.
		Gave later spawning civs some health buildings so they don't start unhealthy.
		Resurrecting civs get better units now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.03.05.:

	Bugfix:
		Fixed English UP for real
		Fixed Spanish Religion Goal
		Fixed 2nd French UHV (culture)
		Fixed all colony UHVs
		Fixed cottage growth display bug
		Fixed how worker-rate modifiers are handled

	Misc:
		Made .xml file for Great Person name list so that these should show up correctly now
		Introduced some more Corporation Competition
		Pushed Corporations a bit back in time
		Fiddled with Colors/flags many civs. Flag symbols still need work. Still need many new buttons. Colors are approaching final colors.
		Replaced Bank-spread exec with new model
		Change Kievan Leader Name to Yaroslav the Wise
		Fixed Hudson Bay Colony Art
		Introduced East/West India Art
		Updated Art for Moscow UB (Currently medieval walls with towers, Civilopedia entry still looks like normal walls...)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.27.:

	New Features:
		More work on corporations. Some executive art included, though "spreading" animation is lacking. Less-bad corporate HQ building art. All special knights now included, and new Portuguese UU included.
		Limited version of Judaism added, though this may introduce some oddities in religion spreading for now. Currently this religion does nothing.
		Added new period/area-appropriate GP names compiled by Jessiecat

	Misc:
		French UB, Salon, moved to Scientific Method just like Observatory
		Konnik brought into line with new Horse Archer (both with cost and First Strikes)
		Adjusted Ghazi/Berber costs
		Adjusted Beserker cost
		Theodosian Walls now pre-built in Constantinople to make it harder to take initially
		Cordoba is weaker, Spain stronger, in attempt to get better Iberian dynamic
		Burgundy and France are friendlier initially (though they still tend to go to war too often)
		Unit costs raised by 50% across the board
		Fixed bug with English UP (just an offset in Consts.py) so now they don't have super mines anymore
		Changed Polish color/flag, mostly just to check that I could
		Other civ colors changed, though much work remains to sync colors with potential flags

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.22.:

	Corporations added, though still not complete.
		See wiki (http://wikirhye.wikidot.com/rfce-corporations) for plans.
		Specifically -- the military orders are still missing their special units/buildings
		Portugal no longer has a UU, and the executives and HQ buildings art is not yet changed.
		Added some corporation art

	Bugfix:
		Bug-fix preventing Protestantism from spreading
		Bug-fix in getColonies (line 714 of Victory.py) possibly blocking Portugal UHV
		Bug-fix in changeColonies (line 262 of Victory.py)
		Bug-fix which was blocking cottage growth. Cottages still incorrectly report time to grow.

	Balance:
		Trading companies come earlier (they had been re-positioned on the tree, but their prereqs are now relaxed)
		Turkish spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Swedish spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Dutch spawn troops and modifiers improved to make it more powerful
		Later tech costs (Late Middle Ages and later) costs increased in XML by ~150%. This should help slow tech rate, though probably not enough yet.
		Serfdom drops slow cottage growth and gains Medium upkeep.

	Misc:
		Added colony art splash screens (i.e. on build) from jessiecat.
		Added new resource: Relic, available from Teutonic Knights and (planned) from certain Wonders
		Judaism is back as a stump religion. It should stay confined to Jerusalem for now. Proper implementation will come soon.
		Latest city name map from micbic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.17.:

	Protestantism:
		Added modified protestantism code from Panoptican's Protestantism for RFC, see that mod for full details.
		Protestantism is founded if you are Catholic State Religion and first to research (or acquire) Printing Press.
		When this happens every nation has choice to flip (converting Catholic buildings and cities) or not. AI goes randomly (based partly on history), human chooses.
		Some Catholics may linger if you flip and some Protestants may spawn even if you refuse to flip.

	Units:
		Restored Pinch Promotion
		Removed Longbow city defense bonus
		Mounted Infantry now upgrade to foot-knights (remove city-raider knights)
		Horse Archer made weaker (strength 5)
		Spearmen and Guisarme bonus vs. heavy cavalry raised from 50% to 75%

	Resources:
		Added "Atlantic Access" to strategic places on map. Revealed with Astronomy.
		AAs sort of crudely represent important ports on the Atlantic and are distributed to encourage the historic colonizers (England, Spain, Portugal, France, Dutch) to build colonies.
		Atlantic Access has some artwork now

	Misc:
		New intro screen from Jessiecat
		Latest city name maps from Micbic
		Arabic technologies associated with earlier era.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for Test Version 2009.02.03.:

	New Art:
		New Colony Icons
		Introduced eras. New era splash screens and names. Let me know of any artwork/sounds oddities due to this.
		A Mappa Mundi for the initial splash screen.

	Misc:
		Tweaked colony resources and added Virginia and East Africa
		Removed 1st early annoying plague
		Gave Portugal better starting units
		Mercs now spawn at your capitol
		AI shouldn't bug you to switch to Paganism anymore
		Include updated Frankia UHV map
		Re-arranged building order a little to be consistent.
		England now starts with a couple Lancers and without warriors
		England now gains armored lancers if anyone declares war on-spawn
		Barb warriors in Wales and barb axe/spear spawn in Scotland so unification is harder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first initial test version of RFCE (basically unplayable) appeared at 2008.08.15.
Based on 3Miro's words:
Following a week long struggle with the code on all levels, I came up with a test version which we can actually run.
One can now start the damn thing, select the Byzantines and play. There are no other main RFCE civs present and one cannot even build a settler.

There were a lot of early test version in the first half year, adding the initial civs and all the necessary things.
A base for a couple of the most basic and most important RFCE specific stuff appeared as well.
I couldn't find any log about these early changes, but it's probably not that relevant.
By the end of 2008 (or early 2009), everything started to get into shape, and we have a complete changelog since 2009 February.
Obviously, more or less everything evolved/improved/revised/changed since, see the very long list of changes above...

Countless hours of development were put into the mod, by various modders/helpers.
I (and I'm sure everyone else who ever contributed as well) hope you will have fun with it!
Cheers: Absinthe
