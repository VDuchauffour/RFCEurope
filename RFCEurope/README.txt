Welcome to Rhye's and Fall of Europe, a mod based on the incredibly popular original Rhye's and Fall of Civilizations (RFC). If you've played RFC before, all the familiar elements are here: stability, plagues, dynamic rises, barbarian uprisings, Unique Powers, Unique Historical Victories, and uniquely customized parameters designed to simulate history while allowing you the freedom to change it. In order to simulate a time period (500 - 1800 AD) and region in greater depth we've created a new huge map of Europe with new resources and new terrain. We've also added new civilizations, a new tech tree, new units, new civics, new corporations, new buildings and wonders. Religion, so critical in this period, has been made much more important. Faith points, a new concept, provide unique benefits for each religion based on how pious your civilization is. 

The mod is now in beta testing. We are looking for feedback on the gameplay experience and the level of difficulty of the Unique Historical Victories. Please post your thoughts in our forum at http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?f=386

You can find more details in the Manual and Reference folders in the mod. A copy of the manual is also available at http://rfceurope.sourceforge.net/
