- Fixed the timing for the Kiev's UHV
- Kiev UHV now requires 10 grain resources
- Kiev spelling changes as suggested
- Added the Great Schism: Orthodox and Catholic players treat each other as "brothers in faith" until 1054AD
- Fixed the independent constant war bug, now all independents go to peace after some time
- Fixed a AI vs Independents war bug, used to be the AI wouldn't go to war against some independents
- Now Crusaders get siege Weapons as well (Jerusalem cannot fall otherwise)
- The first Catholic nation that captures Jerusalem gets the 8 tiles adjacent to it, i.e. establishes a small Crusader state and is not immediately devoured by the Arabic culture
- Try to make Crusader spawn not across the river from Jerusalem (less defensive bonuses for the city)
- Religion cannot be purged out of its holy city
- Religious prosecutions are not possible in Jerusalem
- Jerusalem and the various Holy Cities cannot be razed
- Fixed a bug making the AI agree on Defensive Pacts very easily
- Defensive Pacts between players of different religions is much less likely
- Defensive Pact trading now enables with Military Tradition (as opposed to Chivalry)
- Independent culture in cities dissolves with time, no more "... join motherland ..." 200 turns after you have conquered an indy city
- Fixed a bug that made sometimes Mongols in the middle of marshes (where they can get nowhere and no one can get to them)
- Bulgar/Kazan and Samara are no longer in the Moscowan spawn areas (Moscow now flip 4 as opposed to 6 cities)
- The Moscow UP now covers maintenance for the civics as well the cities themselves 
- Moscow UHV1 now requires to capture or destroy all Barbarian (Mongol) cities in what is essentially the territory of the former USSR (Riga doesn't count)
- Moscow UHV2 now requires 15 cities
- Fixed a bug that causes the game to become unstable if one has too many trade routes (especially for the Dutch)
- All colonies now require Atlantic Access (except for the two trading companies)
- All colonies but two require one TC or another (as per Jessiecat's idea)

- Minor map update on the Balkans (the Balkan mountain can now be crossed on several locations)
- The Pope can now build unlimited Missionaries and Prosecutors
- Tweaked the Pope's AI to go for the construction of more Missionaries and Prosecutors
- The Pope now sends his Prosecutors to other catholic nations and gifts them (needs to be tested)
- Updated the AI personalities of all leaders to better match their UHVs and situations
- Techs in the Tech tree have better tags for the AI (i.e. the benefits are correctly recognized as military vs gold vs culture)
- Updated visible areas upon spawn (not everything discussed is in, but being able to see land very far away will have no effect on the gameplay)
- Updated contacts on spawn (Byzantines now know the Pope, Kiev doesn't have to wait to meet Bulgaria and Byzantium and so on)
- New Leaderhead graphics for: Burgundy, Bulgaria, Norse, Kiev, Poland, Swedan and the Pope (still need Hungary, Cordoba, Genoa and Austria)
- Updated city name map from micbic
- Included the Russian Addon (I hope properly). There are only a few tags missing (3 + 1 that needs clarification), I have neither the Russian skill nor the tools to translate anything into the numerical values for Cyrillic, sorry!
- If you select to load the mod from the regular Civ Menu, you should immediately be taken to the Civ selection screen
- Iberian WB map update as Michael Vick requested, I hope I got it right


Old Changes for Alpha 1
- RFCEurope is now compatible with BtS 3.19 (and only with BtS 3.19)

- Nerfed the Mongols
- Archers - Crossbowman - Longbowman - Musketman have a higher city defensive bonus (archers are now useful against Axeman and Horse Archers)
- Bulgarian Konnik now costs less than a Lancer, used to be ridiculously expensive
- Starting year, loading time and UHV/UP information now fully exported to XML, should be easier to update
- Updated the Spanish starting year info
- Also the five star ratings are exported to XML, someone should come up with accurate ratings for each Civ
- Map update on the Balkan terrain around Sofia to better represent the highest Balkan mountains and hopefully make the AI settle there (it was a large city even at that time)
- The Pope starts with Catholicism as State Religion
- The Byzantines start with Orthodoxy (their stability is bad without the extra anarchy)
- Projects generate points just like World Wonders
- The first Catholic player who manages to obtain control over Jerusalem will enter a golden age
