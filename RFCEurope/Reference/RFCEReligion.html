<center><h1>Religious Guide</h1></center>

<h3>The Major Religions</h3>
<p>One of the main themes of Medieval Europe was the conflict between various religions. In this mod, we have included Islam and the three branches of Christianity:
Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Protestantism. We have also included Judaism as a minor religion. While you can select Judaism as your state religion,
this is not intended and you will certainly be at a disadvantage. Having Judaism in your cities would cause issues with happiness and
<a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability</a>, however it also means that you can build Jewish Quarters, which will give a large boost to your economy and culture. </p>

<h3>The Holy Cities</h3>
<p>Catholicism, Judaism and Orthodoxy are founded at the start of the game, with Holy Cities at Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople.
Islam is founded on the turn that Arabia spawns, with Holy City at Damascus. The <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#Damascus">FAQ</a> explains why Damascus was the optimal choice for this.
Protestantism is founded by the first Catholic player to research the Printing Press tech, and the Protestant Holy City is chosen at random (much like Holy Cities in regular Civilization IV).
Note that non-Catholic players cannot found Protestantism. Whenever a religion is founded, the Holy Shrine is automatically built in the corresponding Holy City.</p>

<h3>Paganism</h3>
<p>Anyone running the Paganism Civic is considered a "pagan" of no religion. All religions dislike Pagans (-1 Diplomacy Penalty) and in order to convert to any religion
one must first switch away from the Paganism Civic.</p>

<h3>The Great Schism</h3>
<p>Prior to 1054AD, Catholics and Orthodoxs had many differences, but in more ways then not the two branches acted as a single religion. In RFCE, there is a small diplomatic bonus between Catholic and Orthodox players until 1054AD,
and they start treating each other as having different religions only after the Schism.</p>

<h3>Reformation</h3>
<p>The discovery of the Printing Press, more specifically the founding of Protestantism triggers the Reformation.
All Catholic players have the opportunity to convert to the new religion. Conversion changes Catholicism to Protestantism in most of your cities,
and all the religious buildings are converted to their corresponding counterparts. However, Catholicism is not completely removed from all the large cities.
Some Faith Points are also generated from the new religion. The AI's probability to convert is based upon the actual history of the corresponding nation.</p>

<h3>Faith Points</h3>
<p>Faith Points are an abstract concept that determines the level of benefits that a player can obtain from the corresponding religion.</p>
<p>- Civilizations generally start with 0 faith points and can accumulate up to 100.</p>
<p>- Changing the state religion resets the faith points to 0.</p>
<p>- Spread of the state religion throughout the empire and building religious buildings (Temples, Monasteries and Cathedrals) generate faith points.</p>
<p>- Spread of a non-state religion and non-state religion buildings decrease the amount of faith points.</p>
<p>- Faith points provide different benefit for every religion</p>
<p>- Large boost of Faith Points is provided by the Great Theologians (great work of theology), to compensate for the fact that they can no longer build Holy Shrines.</p>
<p>- The current number of Faith Points and the benefits they provide can be seen in the Religious Advisor screen (F7).</p>

<h3>Catholicism</h3>
<p>Catholic players gain a boost in diplomacy depending on the number of Faith Points they have. The other benefits from Catholic Faith Points are less
straight forward. Faith Points are used for Crusades and Papal favor, see the sections about the Crusades and the Pope.</p>

<h3>Islam</h3>
<p>Geographically Islam stretches well beyond the boundaries of our map. Thus, with strong faith (i.e. a lot of Faith Points), 
the Islamic nations receive a boost on their Growth as well as a production discount on their new Units.</p>

<h3>Orthodoxy</h3>
<p>One of the key concepts of the Orthodox Church is the principle of Caesaropapism, which is the subjugation of the religious authority under the secular authority.
As a result, strong faith boosts the stability of the Orthodox nations and lowers the civic maintenance cost.</p>

<h3>Protestantism</h3>
<p>The new liberal ideas and the emphasis on personal freedom grant the Protestant nations a beaker discount on new techs and a hammer discount on the production of Colonies and Wonders.</p>

<h3>Religious Persecutions and Stability</h3>
<p>As ugly as they were, inquisition and religious persecutions in general were very common in medieval Europe. 
Thus, in RFCE we present the Persecutor unit that can be used to remove non-state religions and buildings from a given city.</p>
<p>- Non-state religion in your cities causes instability, see the <a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability Guide</a> for details. So even though persecution causes temporary problems, it will benefit you in the long term.
Note that the Polish UP negates this instability.</p>
<p>- Persecutions can remove one of the non-state religions and all the buildings related to that.</p>
<p>- If a city has multiple non-state religions, the target religion is to be chosen from a pop-up menu for the human player, while the AI will choose it's target religion based on preset order of the religions.</p>
<p>- Holy cities cannot be persecuted from their holy religion. Your state religion also cannot be persecuted, and one can only persecute with a state religion.</p>
<p>- Persecution has a base chance to succeed between 60% and 90%, based on your civ's faith. This chance is lower if the target religion has religious buildings or wonders in it's city.</p>
<p>- If persecution succeeds, all religious buildings are destroyed (including religious wonders).</p>
<p>- Your city will suffer from a small revolt and a couple turns of unhappiness after both successful and unsuccessful persecution.</p>
<p>- Short term stability loss (Swing Stability) after successful persecution. Nore that Spain does not suffer from this Persecution penalty, but they do suffer from unhappiness.</p>
<p>- Some of the population is killed/expelled if persecution succeeds, but you get a gold loot from the killed/expelled population and the destroyed buildings.</p>
<p>- Successful persecution increases your faith by one. This bonus is on top of getting rid of the negative faith point modifiers from having a non-state religion or buildings in your city.</p>
<p>- The combined Persecution instability vs. the possibly added Orthodox stability (from the Faith Points) still generates short term instability.</p>
<p>- When Jews are being persecuted from one city, they automatically move to another from the same or different nation.</p>
<p>- Under the Free Religion civic Persecutions are impossible, but no instability is generated from numerous religions in the same city.</p>
<p>- In general, Persecution instability and unhappiness wear off over time, so the short term penalty creates a long term benefit.</p>

<h3>The Pope</h3>
<p>The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church and has absolute authority over it.
Every player that chooses Catholicism would have to interact with the Pope in more than one way.</p>
<p>- The Pope can never control any city other than Rome and the Pope's culture cannot extend beyond Rome's cross</p>
<p>- After 752AD the Pope would gift money to faithful Catholic players. The likelihood of receiving a gift depends on the number of Faith Points you have, and your relations with the Pope
(the diplomatic favor, how much does he like or dislike you).</p>
<p>- The Pope would also randomly build Churches and Monasteries for the Catholic nations. The likelihood of receiving a free building depends on the diplomatic favor of the Pope.</p>
<p>- If a player controls Jerusalem, then the chance of receiving a gift increases tremendously. Also the rate at which the Pope gifts gold increases after 1053AD.</p>
<p>- Relations with the Pope play a major role in the Crusade dynamics.</p>
<p>- To get any benefits and gifts from the Pope you must have Open Borders with him.</p>
<p>- If you have Open Borders with the Pope, you will soon see an army of Missionaries spreading Catholicism for you.</p>
<p>- On the same note, if you are a non-Catholic player, Open Borders with the Pope is probability not a good idea (see Persecutions and Stability).</p>
<p>- The Pope can use Persecutors to remove non-Catholic religions and buildings from the cities of Catholic players.</p>

<h3>Crusades for the Holy Land</h3>
<p>- The Pope can call for a Crusade for the Holy Land. This can happen five times at most in a game.</p>
<p>- A Crusade is only called if Jerusalem is controlled by a player who is neither Catholic nor Orthodox.</p>
<p>- The five Crusades can happen any time after 1099AD, 1147AD, 1187AD, 1202AD and 1229AD.</p>
<p>- No Crusades for the Holy Land can be called once the Reformation has started.</p>
<p>- Every Catholic nation can participate in the Crusade, sending some of their units into the crusading army (city defenders do not get sent off, but other units leave).</p>
<p>- You can check the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#CrusadeLessUnits">FAQ</a> for hints on how to prevent your unit from leaving.</p>
<p>- Teutonic Knights and Knight Templars are very likely to leave for the Crusade, Knights are also generally more likely to leave then Archers.</p>
<p>- You can check the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#CrusadeMoreUnits">FAQ</a> for hints on how to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>- All participants get to vote on a Crusade leader, while the candidates are chosen based on: high Faith Points, Empire size and good relations with the Pope.</p>
<p>- The chosen leader of the Crusade declares war on whomever controls Jerusalem and a few turns later receives a stack of units next to the city.</p>
<p>- The first Catholic player that captures Jerusalem (with or without a Crusade) receives a Golden Age as well as a boost of stability and faith.</p>
<p>- The refusal of participating in a Crusade greatly decreases your faith and your relations with the Pope.</p>

<h3>4th Crusade: how to steal a Crusade</h3>
<p>The 4th Crusade started with the intentions to capture and control Jerusalem, however, it soon turned into an attempt by the Venetians to eliminate their main
competitor for Mediterranean trade (i.e. the Byzantines). Thus in the game we have introduced a mechanics to represent this: the use of financial power to take over a Crusade.</p>
<p>- Any Crusade other than the first one can be stolen.</p>
<p>- Two consecutive Crusades cannot be stolen, one should wait one Crusade before they can try to steal an new one.</p>
<p>- Whenever a Crusade is called, the richest Catholic player can spend 1/4 of their Gold to take control over the Crusade.</p>
<p>- If a player steals the Crusade, that player becomes the new Crusader leader and they can pick a new target city.</p>
<p>- The new target for the stolen Crusade can be either Jerusalem or the capital of any non-Catholic player (including any Orthodox player).</p>
<p>- Note that the stolen Crusades are slightly weaker.</p>
<p>- The AI of Venice and Genoa would always try to steal a Crusade and send it towards Constantinople (if Byzantium is alive).</p>
<p>- The AI for Spain would always try to steal a Crusade and send it towards Cordoba (if Cordoba is alive).</p>

<h3>Defensive Crusades</h3>
<p>- Every Catholic player has a unique Defensive Crusader Map. If a non-Catholic and non-Orthodox player owns a city inside a Crusader map and is already at war with the given Catholic
player, then the Pope may call for a Defensive Crusade to aid the Catholics.</p>
<p>- Defensive Crusade means that the Catholic nation will get some extra units in it's Capital.</p>
<p>- Defensive Crusades can be called any time after 1000AD until the end of the game (i.e. 1800AD).</p>

<h3>General Crusader Hints</h3>
<p>- If you are an Islamic player, there is a great chance you will get hit by at least one of the Crusades: Crusade for Jerusalem (Arabia), a Stolen Crusade (Cordoba), or a Defensive Crusade (Cordoba and Turkey).</p>
<p>- Orthodox players are generally safe from Crusaders, however, if you are playing as the Byzantines, you should be careful about Stolen Crusades.</p>
<p>- The Reformation puts an end to most Crusades, hence Protestants should only worry about Catholic's Defensive Crusades.</p>
<p>- Defensive Crusades can also happen against Pagans.</p>
