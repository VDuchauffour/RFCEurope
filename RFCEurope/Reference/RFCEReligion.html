<center><h1>Religious Guide</h1></center>

<h3>The Major Religions</h3>
<p>One of the main themes of the Medieval Europe was the conflict between various religions. In this mod, we have included Islam and the three branches of Christianity:
Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Protestantism. We have also included Judaism as a minor religion, while you can select Judaism as your state religion,
this is not intended and you will certainly be at a disadvantage. Having Judaism in your cities would cause issues with happiness and 
<a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability</a>, however, you can also build Jewish Quarters that will have a large boost on your economy and culture. </p>

<h3>The Holy Cities</h3>
<p>Catholicism, Judaism and Orthodoxy are founded at the start of the game, with Holy Cities at Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople. 
Islam is founded on the turn that Arabia spawns, with Holy City at Damascus. The <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#Damascus">FAQ</a> explains why Damascus was the optimal choice.
Protestantism is founded by the first Catholic player to research the Printing Press, the Protestant Holy City is chosen at random, much like Holy Cities in regular Civilization IV.
Note that non-Catholic players cannot found Protestantism. Whenever a religion is founded, the Holy Shrine is automatically build in the corresponding Holy City.</p>

<h3>Paganism</h3>
<p>Anyone running the Paganism Civic is considered a "pagan" of no religion. All religions dislike Pagans (-1 Diplomacy Penalty) and in order to convert to any religion
one must first switch away from Paganism Civic.</p>

<h3>The Great Schism</h3>
<p>Prior to 1054AD, Catholics and Orthodoxes had many differences, but in more ways then not acted as a single religion. In RFCE, there is a small diplomatic bonus between Catholic and Orthodox players, until 1054AD
and only after that do they start treating each other as having different religions.</p>

<h3>Reformation</h3>
<p>The discovery of the Printing Press and founding Protestantism trigger the Reformation. 
All Catholic players have the opportunity to convert to the new religion. Conversion changes Catholicism to Protestantism and all the religious buildings are converted to their corresponding counterparts, 
however, Catholicism is not completely removed from all the large cities. Some of the Faith Points are also generated. 
The AI's probability to convert is based upon the actual history of the corresponding nation.</p>

<h3>Faith Points</h3>
<p>Faith points are an abstract concept that determines the level of benefits that a player can obtain from the corresponding religion.</p>
<p>- Civilizations generally start with 0 faith points and can accumulate up to 100.</p>
<p>- Changing the state religion resets the faith points to 0.</p>
<p>- Spread of the state religion throughout the empire and building religious buildings (Temples, Monasteries and Cathedrals) generate faith points.</p>
<p>- Spread of a non-state religion decreases the amount of faith points.</p>
<p>- Faith points provide different benefit for every religion</p>
<p>- Large boost of Faith Points is provided by the Great Theologians to compensate for the fact that they can no longer build Holy Shrines</p>
<p>- The current number of Faith Points and the benefits they provide can be seen in the Religious Advisor screen (F7)</p>

<h3>Catholicism</h3>
<p>Catholic players gain a boost in diplomacy depending on the number of Faith Points that they have. The other benefits from Catholic Faith Points are less
straight forward. FP are used for Crusades and Papal favor, see the sections about the Crusades and the Pope.</p>

<h3>Islam</h3>
<p>Geographically Islam stretches well beyond the boundaries of our map. Thus, with strong faith (i.e. a lot of Faith Points), 
the Islamic nations receive a boost on their Growth as well as a hammer discount for new Units.</p>

<h3>Orthodoxy</h3>
<p>One of the key concepts of the Orthodox Church is the principle of Caesaropapism, that is the subjugation of the religious authority under the secular authority. 
As a result, strong faith boosts the stability of the Orthodox nations and lowers the civic maintenance cost.</p>

<h3>Protestantism</h3>
<p>The new liberal ideas and emphasis on personal freedom, grant the Protestant nations beaker discount for new techs and hammer discount on the production of Colonies and Wonders.</p>

<h3>Religious Prosecutions and Stability</h3>
<p>As ugly as they were, religious prosecutions were very common in medieval Europe. 
Thus, in RFCE we present the Prosecutor unit that can be used to remove all non-state religions and buildings from a given city.</p>
<p>- non-state religion in your cities causes instability, see the <a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability Guide</a> for details.
Note that the Polish UP negates this instability.</p>
<p>- Prosecutions remove the non-state religion and buildings, but generate unhappiness and cause instability of their own, resulting in an even larger penalty</p>
<p>- Prosecution instability and unhappiness wear off over time, so the short term penalty creates a long term benefit</p>
<p>- Spain does not suffer from Prosecution penalty, however, they do suffer from unhappiness</p>
<p>- Prosecutions generate Faith Points</p>
<p>- The combined Prosecution instability vs added Faith Points and boost of Orthodox stability still generates short term instability</p>
<p>- Religion cannot be removed from its Holy City (i.e. no religion can be completely destroyed) and no religion can be removed form Jerusalem</p>
<p>- Religion cannot be removed from a city that has a World Wonder associated with that religion (i.e. if the Wonder has the religion as a prerequisite, then you cannot prosecute the religion) </p>
<p>- When Jews are being prosecuted from one city, they automatically move to another from the same or different nation</p>
<p>- Under the civic Free Religion, Prosecutions are impossible and no instability is generated by numerous religions in the same city</p>

<h3>The Pope</h3>
<p>The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church and has absolute authority over it.
Every player that choses Catholicism would have to interact with the Pope in more than one way.</p>
<p>- The Pope can never control any city other than Rome and the Pope's culture cannot extend beyond Rome's cross</p>
<p>- after 752AD The Pope would gift money to faithful Catholic players. The likelihood of receiving a gift depends on the number of Faith Points and the total diplomatic favor of the Pope
(i.e. by how many points the Pope likes or dislikes you). The rate at which the Pope gifts gold increases after 1053AD.</p>
<p>- The Pope would also randomly build Churches and Monasteries for the Catholic nations. The likelihood of receiving a building gift depends on the diplomatic favor of the Pope.
Furthermore, if a player controls Jerusalem, then the chance of receiving a gift increases tremendously.</p>
<p>- Relations with the Pope play a major role in the Crusade dynamics</p>
<p>- To get any benefits from the Pope you must Open Borders with him</p>
<p>- If you Open Borders with the Pope, you will soon see an army of Missionaries spreading Catholicism for you</p>
<p>- On the same note, for a non-Catholic player, Open Borders with the Pope is probability not a good idea (see Prosecutions and Stability)</p>
<p>- The Pope can remove non-Catholic religions from the cities of Catholic players (generating unhappiness and instability for the corresponding player)</p>

<h3>Crusades for the Holy Land</h3>
<p>- At most five times, the Pope can call for a Crusade for the Holy Land.</p>
<p>- A Crusade is called only if Jerusalem is controlled by a non-Catholic and non-Orthodox player</p>
<p>- The five Crusades can happen any time after 1099AD, 1147AD, 1187AD, 1202AD and 1229AD</p>
<p>- No Crusades for the Holy Land can be called once the Reformation has started</p>
<p>- Every Catholic nation can participate in the Crusade, sending some units at random (city defenders do not get send off, but other units leave)</p>
<p>- You can check the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#CrusadeLessUnits">FAQ</a> for hints on how to prevents your unit from leaving</p>
<p>- Teutonic Knights and Knight Templars are very likely to leave for the Crusade, Knights are also generally more likely to leave then Archers</p>
<p>- You can check the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#CrusadeMoreUnits">FAQ</a> for hints on how to take advantage of this</p>
<p>- All participants get to vote on a Crusade leader, where the candidates are chosen for their high Faith Points, size of the Empire and good relations with the Pope</p>
<p>- The chosen leader of the Crusade declares war on whomever controls Jerusalem and a few turns later receives a stack of units next to the city</p>
<p>- The first Catholic player that captures Jerusalem (with or without a Crusade) receives a Golden Age as well as boost of stability and faith</p>
<p>- Refusal to participate in the Crusade decreases one's faith and relations with the Pope</p>

<h3>4th Crusade: how to steal a Crusade</h3>
<p>The 4th Crusade started with the intentions to capture and control Jerusalem, however, it soon turned into an attempt by the Venetians to eliminate their main
competitor for Mediterranean trade (i.e. the Byzantines). Thus in the game we have given introduced the mechanics to use financial power to take over a Crusade.</p>
<p>- Any Crusade other than the first one can be stolen</p>
<p>- Two consecutive Crusades cannot be stolen, one should wait one Crusade before they can try to steal an new one</p>
<p>- Whenever a Crusade is called, if the richest Catholic player can spend 1/4 of their Gold to take control over the Crusade</p>
<p>- If a player steals the Crusade, that player becomes the new Crusader leader and they can pick a new target city</p>
<p>- The new target for the stolen Crusade can be either Jerusalem or the capital of any non-Catholic player (including any Orthodox player)</p>
<p>- The stolen Crusades are slightly weaker</p>
<p>- The AI of Venice and Genoa would always try to steal a Crusade and send it towards Constantinople (if Byzantium is alive)</p>
<p>- The AI for Spain would always try to steal a Crusade and send it towards Cordoba (if Cordoba is alive)</p>

<h3>Defensive Crusades</h3>
<p>- Every Catholic player has a Defensive Crusader Map and if a non-Catholic and non-Orthodox player owns a city inside the Crusader map AND if the Catholic
player is already at war with that player, then the Pope may call for a Defensive Crusade</p>
<p>- Defensive Crusade means that you will get some extra units in your Capital</p>
<p>- Defensive Crusades can be called any time after 1000AD until the end of the game (i.e. 1800AD)</p>

<h3>General Crusader Hints</h3>
<p>- If you are an Islamic player, then you will get hit by the Crusades. Whether it is a Crusade for Jerusalem (Arabia), or a Stolen Crusade (Cordoba), or a Defensive Crusade (Cordoba and Turkey)</p>
<p>- Judaism is not meant to be a state religion and it is very vulnerable to Crusades</p>
<p>- Orthodox players are generally vulnerable to Crusades, however, if you are playing as the Byzantines, you should be careful about Stolen Crusades</p>
<p>- The Reformation puts an end to most Crusades, hence Protestants should only worry about Catholic's Defensive Crusades</p>
<p>- Pagans are vulnerable to all types of Crusades</p>
