<center> <h1>Short Stability Guide</h1></center>

<p>Stability is a new mechanics introduced in RFC and RFCE that provide extra challenge for the players that try to build huge ahistoric Empires.
Even if you have played RFC, you should note that Stability in RFCE works quite a bit different. Make sure to keep track of the Interior Advisor (F2) screen
to see important stability information.</p>

<p>In the case your stability falls below -5 points, cities in your Empire would try to secede and denounce your rule. 
If you drop to -15, then your Empire will collapse and you will be left with only your capital, which means that you have effectively lost the game
(you can still win in some cases, but those would be very special cases).</p>

<p> Cities, Civics, Economy, Expansion categories have two numbers associated with them, permanent and variable. The permanent stability remembers what you 
have done since the beginning of the game. It takes a while to gain or lose points in that category.
The variable is something that you can change completely from one turn to the next by simply doing something different.</p>

<p>- There are 5 categories: Cities, Civics, Economy, Expansion and Swing</p>
<p>- Cities reflect the general mood of your citizens. Religion is an important factor here.</p>
<p>- Civics reflect the combinations of civics that you are using and how often you fall into Anarchy.</p>
<p>- Economy reflects the relative size of your cities vs the improvements in those cities. Discoveries of key technologies also affect this category.</p>
<p>- Expansion is the most important category, although not as important as the rest combined. You need to build cities in stable provinces and make sure you don't lose your cities.</p>
<p>- Swing stability represents short term events that have only momentary effect. Swing stability will always reset to zero in only a few short turns.</p>

<p>The general advice is to build Stability boosting buildings in all of your cities. Then here is a table of the things that affect your stability. 
The + sign represents a positive event boosting Stability, while - represents a negative effect.</p>

Those techs have a permanent effect on your industry or economic structure or military organization, hence you have to reorganize your society. 
The choice on the specific techs is mostly for balance reasons.</td></tr>

<h2>General Hints for each Category</h2>

<p>Cities: Keep your cities happy and don't let foreign religion.</p>

<p>Civics: Try to change Civics either in the first few turns after spawn (when you have few cities) or better yet, when you are in a Golden Age.
Also, try to pick compatible civics. </p>

<p>Economy: work only improved tiles and make sure to build productions and commerce boosting buildings in all of your large cities.</p>

<p>Expansion: pick your Expansion Civic carefully. If you are on the offense and expect to conquer lots of cities soon, then Militarism is the best civics.
If you already have lots of cities outside of your core area and you have slowed your expansion, you can switch to Imperialism that will help you
keep the conquered territory under control. If you don't expand militarily, but rather surround yourself with a wall of vassals, then you should
run Vassalage. Colonialism if for the Colonial powers, especially the small civilizations that build a lot of colonies.</p>

<p>The Swing category changes back to zero very fast. However, you should keep in mind that long periods of continuous Anarchy or losing many cities at once would be bad.</p>
