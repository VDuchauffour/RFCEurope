<center> <h1>Short Stability Guide</h1></center>

<p>Stability is a new mechanics introduced in RFC and RFCE that provide extra challenge for the players that try to build huge ahistoric Empires.
Even if you have played RFC, you should note that Stability in RFCE works quite a bit different. Make sure to keep track of the Interior Advisor (F2) screen
to see important stability information.</p>

<p>In the case your stability falls below -5 points, cities in your Empire would try to secede and denounce your rule. 
If you drop to -15, then your Empire will collapse and you will be left with only your capital, which means that you have effectively lost the game
(you can still win in some cases, but those would be very special cases).</p>

<p> Cities, Civics, Economy, Expansion categories have two numbers associated with them, permanent and variable. The permanent stability remembers what you 
have done since the beginning of the game. It takes a while to gain or lose points in that category.
The variable is something that you can change completely from one turn to the next by simply doing something differently.</p>

<p>- There are 5 categories: Cities, Civics, Economy, Expansion and Swing</p>
<p>- Cities reflect the general mood of your citizens. Religion is an important factor here.</p>
<p>- Civics reflect the combinations of civics that you are using and how often you fall into Anarchy.</p>
<p>- Economy reflects the relative size of your cities vs. the improvements in those cities. Discoveries of key technologies also affect this category.</p>
<p>- Expansion is the most important category, although not as important as the rest combined. You need to build cities in stable provinces and make sure you don't lose your cities.</p>
<p>- Swing stability represents short term events that have only momentary effect. Swing stability will always reset to zero after a few turns.</p>

<p>The general advice is to build Stability boosting buildings in all of your cities. Here is a detailed table of all events that affect your stability.
The + sign represents a positive effect (boosting your Stability), while the - sign represents a negative effect.</p>

<tr><td>-1</td><td>For the discovery of: Feudalism, Guilds, Gunpowder, Aristocracy, Civil Service, Machinery, Professional Army, Nationalism, Economics.
Those techs have a permanent effect on your industry or economic structure or military organization, hence you have to reorganize your society. 
The choice on the specific techs is mostly for balance reasons.</td></tr>

<tr><td>-2</td><td>For each city building a World Wonder (this combines with the military unit penalty).</td></tr>
<tr><td>-3 to +3</td><td>For having large food and hammer production per unit population, the requirement is higher for larger cities to encourage building production boosting buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-4 to +4</td><td>For having a large amount of gold and beakers, open borders trade as well as low inflation. This computed per capita and is influenced by gold and beaker boosting buildings.</td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="11">Expansion - Permanent</td>
<td>+1</td><td>For each city founded in a stable province.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+1</td><td>For founding a city while having less than 5 cities (helps small empires in their initial expansion).</td></tr>

<h2>General Hints for each Category</h2>

<p>Cities: Keep your cities happy and avoid foreign (non-state) religions wherever possible.</p>

<p>Civics: Try to change Civics either in the first few turns after spawn (when you have few cities) or better yet, when you are in a Golden Age.
Also, try to pick compatible civics. </p>

<p>Economy: Work only improved tiles and make sure to build production and commerce boosting buildings in all of your large cities.</p>

<p>Expansion: Pick your Expansion Civic carefully. If you are on the offense and expect to conquer lots of cities soon, then Militarism is the best civic.
If you already have lots of cities outside your core area and you have slowed your expansion, you should switch to Imperialism, that will help you
keep the conquered territory under control. If you don't plan to expand militarily, rather surround yourself with a wall of vassals, then you should
run Vassalage. Colonialism is great for the Colonial powers, especially for relatively small civilizations that build a lot of colonies.</p>

<p>The Swing category changes back to zero very fast. However, you should keep in mind that long periods of continuous Anarchy or losing many cities at once will cost you greatly.</p>
