<a name="iByzantium">
<h2>Byzantine Empire</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>So long as the Byzantines have control over Constantinople, they cannot collapse and cities within their core area will not rebell. On the other hand, if they are to lose Constantinople, they suffer from a bigger stability hit than other civs.</p>

<a name="iFrankia">
<h2>France/Frank Empire</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>France gets a boost for each city in OK and Unstable provinces, much like the Imperialism civic. The boost is capped at 6 points.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The hardest UHV condition is to get the cities early on. There are several viable strategies, but the timing should be well executed. Mounte Sergants can help a lot and a good time to attack the Independents (especially in Italy) is right after the plague.</p>
<p>The Crusader UHV should be careful about rebelling Jerusalem. One viable strategy is to keep taking control over the Crusades, but conquer the rest of the area first before getting Jerusalem itself.</p>

<a name="iArabia">
<h2>Arabia</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Whenever you acquire a new city, you state religion will automatically spread to it along with a free Temple. This is very useful to achieve the UHV.</p>
<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The hardest UHV condition is to spread Islam. You an do it in several different ways, build huge cities with the Islamic faith power, conquer Byzantium early on or wait for the Ottomans to do the conquering (just make sure to keep them friendly).</p>

<a name="iBulgaria">
<h2>Bulgaria</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Newly conquered cities do not resist, but get right to work.</p>
<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Sometimes you can get lucky to capture Constantinople early on, this happens if the Plague kills all the defenders. If not, then make sure to capture Odrin and Solun as soon as possible, then focus on Konniks AND make sure to bring lots of Catapults.</p>
<p>The second UHV relies on using Constantinople to get plenty of Theologians and use them to build up faith points.</p>
<p>For the Ottoman UHV, you have to refuce the flip of Odrin. If you allow for the city to flip, then you will lose the UHV. Also, remember that if you refuse the flip, then some of your units will defect, plan with a large army.</p>

<a name="iCordoba">
<h2>Cordoba</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All units start with Medic I promotion.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>To win the first UHV, you have to settle a city right on the spot where you spawn. Then you must compete with Constantinople for size.</p>
<p>For the last UHV, you don't have to kill Spain or Portugal, just make sure that you have Open Borders and spread Islam with missionaries. However, Spain can prosecute non-Catholic religions rather aggressively, so conquest is perfectly reasonable option.</p>

<a name="iNorse">
<h2>The Norse/Vikings</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All naval units can enter and move through Ocean tiles.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Being able to move across Ocean means that you are the only one who can settle Iceland early on. Also, trade over Ocean tiles is also enabled early on, so you can have North America access in all of your cities and ultimately build the Vinland project back in Denmark.</p>
<p>Use the UP to hide ships in safe territory and heal Berserkers, then launch fast attacks to coastal cities. Make sure you send troops to Sicily early enough so they can reach there and remember that ships move twice as fast accross Ocean tiles.</p>

<a name="iVenecia">
<h2>Venice</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Venetians start with a Merchant Republic civic on turn 1, much sooner than other players can use it.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The easiest way to conquer Constantinople is get enough gold to steal a Crusade. Direct assult is also an option, but you will be fighting a larger and more powerful Empire. Another option is combine forces with Bulgaria.</p>
<p>For the last UHV, you need the resource Atlantic Access. Probably the best place to get one is right at the Gibraltar straight, but you will have to fight Spain or Cordoba for control over it.</p>

<a name="iBurgundy">
<h2>Burgundy</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>+2 Culture and +1 Happiness in every city.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The culture points are accumulated every turn depending on what your cities produce. Great Artist with culture bombs don't count towards the UHV counter. Great Artists that settle in the cities, count by adding +12 points every turn.</p>

<a name="iGermany">

<a name="iKiev">
<h2>Kiev Rus</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>The central tile of every city produces 4, instead of 2 food.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The biggest challange is the defence against the Mongols. Note that the Keshiks are Light Cavalry and hence the Formation promotion will not help. Use Drujina's with two combat promotions and Knights. Polearm units can defend your cities, but if you let the Mongols pillage all of your farms, you will have hard time with the first UHV.</p>
<p>The first UHV requires to get many cities as early as possible. The longer you hold a city, the more food it produces and it adds up every turn.</p>
<p>The second UHV requires you to spread out and the third one requires you to build culture and not just military. Plan well and balance your attention and resources.</p>

<a name="iHungary">
<h2>Hungary</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>You do not suffer "we want to join the motherland" unhappines and you don't suffer stability penalty from foreign culture in your cities. You also get +1 happiness.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>The easiest way to get Free Religion is to build the Golden Bull and get access to all Religious Civics. You can do that fairly early on.</p>
<p>The Ottomans can be tricky, you must push them out of the Balkans. Bulgaria will always lose Odrin and the Byzantines cannot hold Constantiople on their own. You should make friends with Bulgaria and Byzantium and aggressively attack the Ottomans.</p>

<a name="iSpain">
<h2>Spain</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>+2 espionage points per city and you can prosecute foreign religion without stability penalty. You still get unhappiness and you still get stability hit from the unhappiness.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Kill Cordoba fast, if they build any Islamic wonder in Iberia you will have to raze the city. Also, beware of Portugal starting the Reformation, if the Protestant Holy City is in Iberia, then you can neither prosecute, nor raze it. Take advantage of the defensive Crusades.</p>
<p>The last UHV you will have to grow in strenght as much as possible and be aggressive towards other religions. By this time, Protestants (France, Germany and England) and Muslims (Ottomans) would be the biggest threat. Use the Victory screen to pick a target.</p>

<a name="iPoland">
<h2>Poland</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Foreign religion will cause neither unhappiness nor instability.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>

<a name="iGenoa">
<h2>Genoa</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Both hiring and upkeep cost for Mercenaries is halved.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Export and Imports are counted by counting the amount of commerce produced by the trade routes with other nations and the amount produced by the other nations trading with you. To maximize trade, Open Borders with as many nations as possible, preferably if they are far away. Then get buildings and civics that will boost the number of trade routes or the commerce generated by trade routes. Sea trade routes generate extra commerce, so island cities will contribute more than cities on dry land connected by roads.</p>

<a name="iEngland">
<h2>England</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Workshops give +2 hammers, this effectively makes a grassland tile with workshop equal to a mine.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Conquering France can be hard. One strategy is to take some time, build up a large army and then make a quick strike at Paris. If you get the city, with some luck France will collapse leaving only weak independent cities to be conquered.</p>
<p>Protestantism is a good choice for late game religion to give you a boost with both colonies and research.</p>

<a name="iPortugal">
<h2>Portugal</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>All colonial projects and Trading Companies are 40% cheaper.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Be careful where you expand, you may conquer cities early on, even capture Cordoba, however, keep in mind that if Cordoba is gone, then Spain will probably attack you next.</p>

<a name="iAustria">
<h2>Austria</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Austria gets a hidden +4 points modifier with all AI. Austria also gets a +2 points Culture boost per city so that they don't get overwhelmed by the older Germany and Hungary (older players an produce huge amounts of culture).</p>

<a name="iTurkey">
<h2>Ottoman Empire</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Every turn we check all of the Ottoman cities. For every city with religion other than the state religion, the Ottomans gain Janissary points equal to the size of the city (i.e. 5 points, 12 points and so on). Every 400 points, the Ottomans get a free Janissary unit in a random city.</p>

<a name="iMoscow">
<h2>Moscow</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Civic, number of cities and city distance maintenance cost is halved. Thus Moscow can control a lot more cities with a lot less cost.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Depending on the Balkan situation, you may be able to ally with fellow Orthodox Byzantines and/or Bulgarians to fight either the Ottomans or Crusaders (Venice or Genoa). If the Ottoman Empire is too strong to let go of Constantinople, then you should go over Lithuania and fight Sweden for control of the Baltic Sea. An Atlantic Access resource spawns near Sweden in 1680AD.</p>

<a name="iDutch">
<h2>Netherlands</h2></a>
<h3>Unique Power:</h3>
<p>Every Dutch city has two additional trade routes.</p>

<h4>UHV hints:</h4>
<p>Depending on the starting situation, the Dutch can be very hard to play with. As a small country, it will be hard to hold advances from France, Germany and England. Keep your cities well defended and don't hesitate to pay gold for peace.</p>
<p>Amsterdam Beurs would be of great help, if you can build it.</p>
<p>You can use your initiall second settler to found a city in the Atlantic islands. This is useful since the territory in Europe that you can hope to control is very limited.</p>
