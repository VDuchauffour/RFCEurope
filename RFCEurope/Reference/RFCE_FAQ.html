<center><h1>Generic Questions about the Mod</h1></center>

<a name="Mercs">
<h3>I am getting the message that there are new mercs available, however, there are no mercs in the mercenary screen. Why?</h3></a>
<p>The message indicates that mercenaries are available in the corresponding province, however, you cannot hire mercenaries in a province until
you have at least one city with 20 or more culture points (i.e. one level of culture growth). Check the 
<a href="RFCEMercs.html">Mercenary</a> page for details.</p>

<a name="Paganism">
<h3>Why is it that I cannot convert to a new religion?</h3></a>
<p>Are you running the Paganism civic? You must select one of the Civics that allow for a state religion, that is, any Religious Civic other than Paganism.</p>

<a name="SuniIslam">
<h3>Why isn't the Sunni/Shia schism represented?</h3></a>
<p>Geographically the regions populated by Shia are not included on the map. Europe mostly interacted with Sunni Muslims, thus we have only one denomination of Islam.
If you are interested in an Islam oriented modmod, we strongly recommend <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=373155">The Sword of Islam</a>, which is an RFCE-like mod for Islam.</p>

<a name="Damascus">
<h3>Why is Damascus chosen as the Islamic Holy City?</h3></a>
<p>Mecca and Medina are not included on our map, this have to chose from the cities that are included. Jerusalem is holy for all religions and all Christians get a Holy City in addition to Jerusalem,
it would be unfair for the Muslims to have only one. One can think of Damascus as Islam's second Holy City.
Furthermore, Jerusalem is the main target for the Crusades, it is much better for Arabia to have their capital and Holy City not in the direct path of the Crusaders. 
Thus, we selected Damascus as the Muslim Holy City.</p>

<a name="Persecutions">
<h3>How come I cannot persecute the foreign religion from a city?</h3></a>
<p>Religion cannot be persecuted from its Holy City and persecutions are very hard in Jerusalem. This is done to ensure that no religion can be completely destroyed.
Furthermore, Holy Cities and Jerusalem cannot be razed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, a religion is much harder to be persecuted from a city which has a World Wonder associated with that religion.</p>

<a name="CrusadeLessUnits">
<h3>How can I prevent my units from leaving for a Crusade?</h3></a>
<p>The first 3 units in each city are considered the city garrison and will not leave for the Crusade. Distribute your units so that you don't have more than 3 per city.
Extra units and units outside cities can randomly leave. Mounted units like Knights have a much bigger chance of leaving than defensive units like Archers.
Teutonic and Templar Knights have a very large chance of leaving.</p>

<a name="Crusades">
<h3>How can I get a larger Crusader stack?</h3></a>
<p>Templars and Teutonic Knights are far more likely to leave for a Crusade and every Templar/Teutonic unit that leaves will get an extra unit to appear near Jerusalem.
Furthermore, Templars and Teutonic Knights don't return back once Jerusalem has been taken. Thus you can directly increase the strength of the Crusades by
founding the Templar and Teutonic orders and building extra units of each type.</p>

<a name="PaganCulture">
<h3>I build Pagan Shrine or Shrine of Uppsala, now there is a discrepancy in the culture help.</h3></a>
<p>The Culture is computed correctly, you get +1 culture point for both the Shrine of Uppsala and the Pagan Shrine as long as you don't have a State Religion.
The discrepancy is with the help text only.</p>
