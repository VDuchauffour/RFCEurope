<center> <h1>New features introduced by RFCE and RFC</h1></center>

<p>Our mod is actually a modmod build on top of the official mod of Rhye's and Fall of Civilization. While RFC is quite a bit different from the original game of Civilization IV, our mod is even more different.
If you have played RFC, you will find yourself within quite a lot changes and if you have not played RFC, then you will be faced with a steep learning curve. In order to minimize the pain, here is a short
list of the new features.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Concept</th><th>What it does?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Historic Spawn</td><td>The first thing that you will notice if you play RFC or RFCE is that not all Civilizations start at the same time.
You can see the exact spawn year on the load scenario screen and you can cross check the dates with the European Time-line.
Only the Franks and Byzantines start on turn 1, everyone else would have to wait in Autorun mode, the AI would play without you and you can never predict your exact starting situation.
Naturally this greatly adds to the replayability of the RFC mods.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unique Historic Victory - UHV</td><td>In Civilization IV everyone fights towards the same set of goals, in RFC and RFCE, every civilization has a Unique set of goals. While you can win a game of RFCE by
brute force conquest or final score, it is a lot more fun to achieve the 3 goals specific to your civilization.
You get a Golden Age whenever you achieve any two of those goal and you win the game if you manage to complete all three.
The goals have been chosen in a similar pattern for all civs: two of them are things that the civilization achieved in real history,
while the third is something that the civilization attempted and failed. The ahistoric goal is something that had it happened it would have
potentially changed the history of Europe. For example, the English historically established the largest colonial Empire and did start the Industrial Revolution, however,
the history of Europe would be quite different if they had won the 100 years war. Hints and tips on how to win UHV conditions can be found at the <a href="RFCE_CivSpecificInfo.html">Civ specific page.</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Unique Power - UP</td><td>In Civilization IV leaders have specific traits that help boost certain aspects of their nation. In RFC and RFCE every nation has its own Unique Power. For example
all Burgundy cities have a boost in Culture and Happiness, while Venice starts with Merchant Republic many turns before anyone else has a chance to even discover the required tech. For information about
all the UPs you can see <a href="RFCE_CivSpecificInfo.html">Civ specific page.</a>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medieval Times</td><td>Our mod comes with a completely rewritten Tech tree and completely different set of Units, Buildings, Wonders and Civics. The best place to learn about those
is to read the in-game Civilopedia, it always contains the most up-to-date information.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Provinces</td><td>The map of Europe is divided into historical regions, generically called Provinces. Those are used by the players to identify certain regions of interest.
You can hold down the Control key while hovering your mouse over the map to see the geography of the provinces, while in the bottom left corner you will also see the name and your civ's stability rating of each province.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stability</td><td>Another new concept introduced in RFC and adopted by RFCE. While in the original game of Civilization IV you can build a huge Empire with only a small
penalty of inflation, in RFC and RFCE it is much harder to keep your cities especially if they are outside your "historic" areas. Check the <a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability Guide</a> for more information. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Plague</td><td>Five times in History, Europe would be ravaged by horrible plagues, see the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#Plague">FAQ:Plague</a> for the dates.
The Plague spreads via trade networks and by proximity. You cannot escape from it, although keeping high health in your cities would minimize the effects of the plague.
Infected Cities would rapidly lose population. The weakest garrisoned unit will die and the rest would start losing health every turn. A plague can easily leave your cities
undefended, or alternatively provide conquering opportunities by leaving enemy cities undefended. Units within 3 tiles form an Infected city would also lose health. Only ships are immune
from the plague, which is done mostly for balance reasons.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mercenaries</td><td>Both RFC and RFCE introduce a game concept for Mercenaries, units that you can hire to fight for you while spending only money.
Players that are familiar with RFC's Mercenary scheme should note that RFCE is quite a bit different. Check the <a href="RFCEMercs.html">Mercenary</a> information page for details.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Colonies and Access Resources</td><td>This is a new concept introduced in RFCE.
Colonization had a huge impact on Europe and thus we have included numerous colony projects. In order to build a colony project, you need to gain an Atlantic Access resource.
The locations of such resources are associated with the historical colonial powers (Spain, Portugal, England, France, Netherlands), as well as major naval routes like Gibraltar and the Baltic sea. Note that the Baltic sea
resource appears rather late, in 1680AD. 
The only exception is the special colony of Vinland that only requires North American Access, which can be found near Greenland before 1250AD. Additional Access resources help lower the cost
of constructing the projects. Each colony brings new resources to the player that completes it, and for certain exotic resources this it the only way to get access to them.
To see the colonies that have been founded, you can look at the Info Screen (F9) and then select the Colony tab.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Religion Overhaul</td><td>One of the hallmarks of this mod is the complete overhaul of the religious mechanics. Make sure you read the <a href="RFCEReligion.html">Religious Guide</a>.
