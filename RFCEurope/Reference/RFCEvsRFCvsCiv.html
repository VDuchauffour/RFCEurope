<center> <h1>New features introduced by RFCE and RFC.</h1></center>

<p>Our mod is actually a modmod build on top of the official mod Rhye's and Fall of Civilization. While RFC is quite a bit different from the original game of Civilization IV, our mod is even more different.
If you have played RFC, you will find our mod quite a bit different and if you have not played RFC,then you will be faced with a steep learning curve. In order to minimize the pain, here is a short
list of the new features.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Concept</th><th>What it does?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Historic Spawn</td><td>The first thing that you will notice if you play RFC or RFCE is that not all Civilizations start at the same time. 
You can see the exact spawn year on the load scenario screen and you can cross check with the European Timeline. 
Only the Franks and Byzantines start on turn 1, everyone else would have to wait in Autorun mode, the AI would play without you and you can never predict your exact starting situation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>UHV</td><td>In Civilizaiton IV everyone fights towards the same set of goals, in RFC and RFCE, every civilization has a Unique set of goals. While you can win a game of RFCE by
brute force conquest or final score, the most fun way is to achive the 3 goals specific for your civilization. The goals have been chosen so that 2 of the goals are things that
the civilizaiton achieved in real histroy, while the third is something that the civilizaiton attemped and failed. The ahistoric goal is something that had it happened it would have
potentially changed the history of Europe. For example, the English historically established the largest Colonial Empire and did start the Industrial Revolution, however,
the histroy of Europe would be quite different had the English won the 100 years war.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Provinces</td><td>The map of Europe is divided into historical regions generically called Provinces. Those are used by the players to identify certain regions of interest. 
<b>TODO - Add a province map</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Stability</td><td>This is new concept introduced in RFC and adopted by RFCE. WHile in the original game of Civilization IV you can build a huge Empire with only a small
penalty of inflation, in RFC and RFCE it is much harder to keep cities especially if those are outside of your "historic" areas. Check with the <a href="RFCEStability.html">Stability Guide</a> for more information. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Plague</td><td>Five times in History, Europe would be ravaged by horible plagues, see the <a href="RFCE_FAQ.html#Plague">FAQ:Plague</a> for the dates. 
The Plague spreads via thrade networks and by proximity. You cannot escape the plague, although keeping high health in your cities would minimize the effects of the plague. 
Infected Cities would rapidly lose population. The weakest garasoned unit will die and the rest would start losign health every turn. A plague can easily leave your cities
undefendes, or alternatively provide oportunity by leaving enemy cities undefended. Units within 3 tiles form an Infected city would also lose health. Only ships are immune
from the plague, which is done mostly for balance reasons.</td></tr>
