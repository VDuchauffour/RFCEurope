			<h1>Rhye's and Fall of Europe</a></h1>
			<div class="descr"></div>
			
			<p>Europe, 500 AD. The Western Roman Empire has vanished into history, leaving in its wake only fragmented kingdoms. In the East, the Byzantine Empire retains the splendor and power of Rome, but is beset by internal dissension and external attacks. At the end of 13 long centuries, European Civilizations will emerge as the most powerful and technologically advanced nations in the world, and spread their power through colonies across the globe. Yet for now the Dark Ages are just beginning; for Europe, things will get much blacker before the dawn. New diseases will ravage, new barbarians will sweep through and plunder, and religious wars both internal and external will burn. Kingdoms will rise and fall. What will be the fate of yours?</p>

			<h1>If you haven't played Rhye's and Fall</h1>
			<p>You really should. Here are some of the most important changes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Stability is the most important new addition to the mod. The details are complex, but try to keep your Civ steadily growing within its historical boundaries and your cities peaceful and happy.</li>
			<li>There are research penalties for large empires. Don't expand recklessly.  </li>
			<li>Your first few battles against barbarians are guaranteed wins. Don't waste them. Barbarians spawn somewhat predictably.</li>
			<li>Plague will ravage your empire periodically. Plague lasts longer in unhealthy cities. Also, make sure there are some cheap troops in all cities, they get killed first. Workers can be killed by plagues, get them far away from cities to keep them alive.</li>
			<li>Civilizations each have unique powers (UPs) and specifically tailored abilities, rather than the old trait system.</li>
			<li>Emperor isn't the same as in BtS, it's a monster, designed to destroy the fools who were brave enough to try it. Monarch is the way to go.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>If you have played Rhye's and Fall</h1>
			<p>There's still a lot of new content in our mod. Follow at the links on the right hand side under "Overview of Major Changes" and you'll be up and running in no time. Then, if you want to dive into features in more depth, see the detailed guides.</p>
