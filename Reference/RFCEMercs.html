<center><h1>Mercenary Information</h1></center>

<p>- To access the merc screen, look at icon in the top left corner.</p>
<p>- There are over 100 potential merc units that can be hired by the players.</p>
<p>- Some of the mercs are generic units like Archers, Axemen or Swordsman, others are unique types that cannot be build, but only hired.</p>
<p>- Each merc unit is associated with a time period and a set of provinces.
Every turn, there is a chance that the unit will become available in one of its provinces. If a player controls a city in that province
with at least 10 culture points, then that player can hire the merc. Some mercs have additional religious requirements, for example
Muslims cannot hire Crusader mercs. </p>
<p>- Each merc can come with several promotions.</p>
<p>- To hire a merc, you have to pay one time hiring cost. In addition, every turn where the merc is alive and in your service, you have to pay maintenance cost.</p>
<p>- The maintenance cost of the merc depends on the promotions that it has, the more promotions the higher the cost.</p>
<p>- When you hire mercs, they will become available in a random city in the merc's province. Note that this is different from RFC, where mercs appear in either the capital or the city furthest form the capital.</p>
<p>- Merc become available and can move and attack the same turn that you hire them.</p>
<p>- You can fire a merc either from the merc screen or by disbanding the unit.</p>
<p>- If mercs are not hired for awhile, they will leave and move to another province.</p>
<p>- You will receive messages when new mercs arrive as well as the province where they become available.</p>
<p>- <b>NOTE:</b> If you get a message for new mercs, but there are no mercs available, this means that your cities in the merc's province do not have enough culture. 
Build culture, adjust the culture rate or use Artist specialists to increase your culture so you can hire the merc.</p>
<p>- Unlike RFC you cannot contract your own units as mercs for other players.</p>
