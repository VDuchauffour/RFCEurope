
Info:
As of revision 949, the russian version is a separate download. An add-on to the mod.

The main reason behind this is the need of the original special characters of Civ IV (more or less a Special ASCII HTML Character Code, instead of a russian one)
This will enable us to use such characters on the city name map too: גבהיכםצתף
The character set is close enough to this: http://www.yellowpipe.com/yis/tools/ASCII-HTML-Characters/index.php
Actually we could have those extra characters before, but only in the civilopedia and other texts
Now we can have civ-specific names everywhere, including everything that appear on the map too
Specifically: UUs, UBs, civ specific Great People names, and most importantly: city names
Instead of Russian, Portuguese is being added as the 6th language, as it uses the same gamefont set as the other main languages


How to use:
The mod's dll is still able to use the russian version of the game (or rather the other way around)
So, if you have russian version of Civ IV, you only have to do the following:
Replace the 2 gamefont files, with the 2 provided files in the rar (overwrite them)
Delete the RFCEurope/Assets/XML/Text folder of the mod, and copy over the Text folder from the rar in place of the old one


Important notes:
This is for RFCE revision 949
If you want it to work with later versions, some of the XML files might have to be adjusted, based on the recent changes of those files in the mod
Also, the translations were already very outdated (or even nonexistent for most XML entries) in revision 949
If you are russian, and want to see the translations updated, get in touch with us in the CFC forums
